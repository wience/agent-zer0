# Agent-Zer0 ü§ñ

> Your AI-powered customer service sidekick that never sleeps, never complains, and always has the right answer (well, almost always üòâ)

## üöÄ Project Overview

Meet Agent-Zer0 - the customer service platform that's like having a team of super-smart agents working 24/7, but without the coffee breaks! We've combined cutting-edge AI with a sleek interface to create something that's not just another boring customer service tool.

### What's in the Box? üéÅ

#### Web Application (`/web`) - Your Command Center
Think of it as your mission control, but way cooler:
- Next.js 14 (because we like to live on the edge)
- TypeScript (for those who love their code as organized as their sock drawer)
- Tailwind CSS (making things pretty, one class at a time)
- AI-powered conversation analysis (your digital mind reader)
- Real-time conversation flow management (like GPS for customer conversations)
- Interactive agent dashboard (your personal control room)
- Customer conversation insights (because we love data as much as you do)
- Automated response suggestions (your AI wingman)
- Modern UI components (because looks do matter)
- Supabase integration (your data's cozy home)

#### Crawler (`/crawler`) - The Knowledge Hunter
Our very own digital archaeologist:
- Python-based crawler (digging through docs like a pro)
- JSON processing (making data dance)
- PDF and HTML parsing (because we speak all languages)
- Data cleaning utilities (because nobody likes messy data)

   ```

3. Let it loose:
   ```bash
   python crawl.py
   ```
