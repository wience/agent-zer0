  "content": "GCash Account Express Send Transaction Limit\n\n# . What is the Express Send transaction limit of my GCash account?\n\nYour GCash Account has a monthly limit of 550 send transactions and 500 receive transactions (“Express Send Transaction Limit”).\n\n# 2\\. How does this differ from my wallet limit?\n\nThe Express Send Transaction Limit refers to the maximum number of send and receive transactions using GCash’s Express Send service while your wallet limit refers to the maximum amount you can send and receive within a given month.\n\n# 3\\. How is the Express Send Transaction Limit applied?\n\nYour transaction count resets at the start of each month. Once the limit is reached, you must wait until the next month to create another transaction.\n\n# 4\\. What will happen if I reach the Express Send Transaction Limit?\n\nOnce you reach the Express Send Transaction Limit, you will not be able to make send or receive transactions through GCash’s Express Send service until your limit resets the following month.\n\n# 5\\. What other options do I have if I keep reaching my Express Send Transaction Limit?\n\nIf you are a merchant, and frequently exceed Express Send Transaction Limit, consider upgrading to a GCash Pera Outlet (GPO) account.
