Here’s how to spot a scam transaction:\n\n1. **Unexpected Offers:** Be careful if you get a message or call about winning a prize or getting a big discount or job offer out of nowhere. Scammers lure you of big returns but you are asked first to transfer money to get the prize or reward.\n2. **Pressure to Act Fast:** If someone tells you to do something immediately to avoid a problem, take a step back. Scammers often try to rush you so you don’t have time to think.\n3. **High-yield Investment Offers:** Scammers claim you’ll earn money if you invest with them.\n4. **Product with Below the Market Price:** If a product they’re selling is unbelievably cheap or advertised to have amazing benefits or features that sound too good to be true, it’s likely a scam.\n\nStaying alert and knowing these signs can help you avoid getting scammed.

Here’s how you can identify if someone is trying to phish your information:\n\n1. **Weird Links:** Don’t click on links from unknown sources, even if it says it’s coming from GCash. Fraudsters use fake websites to steal your info.\n2. **Calls asking for Personal Information:** GCash will never ask for your MPIN, or OTP over the phone.\n3. **Fake GCash Pages.** Social media pages are pretending to be giving customer support. Please report the issue only through Gigi or the GCash Help Center.\n4. **People buying or renting your account.** Some individuals may trick you into lending your GCash account and then giving you money in return. Do not engage with them as they may use your name in illegal activities.\n\nOnly refer to our Official GCash pages with a blue check mark and our Help Center through the app or help.gcash.com.\n\nIf you receive any suspicious links, emails, or SMS, they may be from someone pretending to be GCash in an attempt to steal your details. To report this, visit the GCash [Contact Us page](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/p/contact-us) and click **Chat with Gigi.**\n\nStay alert and **don’t share your personal information** to protect your account from scammers.\n\nRelated to\n\n- [gcash guide](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/search?content_tags=01H2WKWZYF1CWP7GXJ680S25Y6&utf8=%E2%9C%93 \"Search results\")\n\n[Previous](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/19577994564761-Reach-your-Money-Goals)\n\nReach your Money Goals\n\n[Next](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/19578518834457-Protect-Your-GCash-Account#)\n\n- [My GCash payment or transaction was unsuccessful but my wallet was deducted.
