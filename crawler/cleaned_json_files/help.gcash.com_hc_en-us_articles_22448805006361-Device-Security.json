Go to your phone Settings and search for “ **Unknown Sources/Apps**” or “ **Untrusted Sources**”. The location may vary depending on the device brand and model.\n2. For all apps, toggle the button to disable this setting\n3. Once disabled, force restart and try to open the GCash app again.\n\n#### **Disable Developer Options**\n\nDeveloper Options enables you to adjust and configure your operating system for testing and applications.
