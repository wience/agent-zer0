Here’s how the referral process works:\n\n### **How to refer someone for Jobs on GCash**\n\nYou will receive **6 referral credits** for each job opening. When **you send a referral email to someone** (the referee), a referral credit will be deducted from your account. A credit will also be deducted when the **referee clicks on your referral link**.\n\nTo refer someone, follow these steps:\n\n1. On your GCash app, tap **View All Services > Jobs**\n2. Search through a job list and tap **Refer**\n3. Select **Email** and enter the full name and email of your referral\n4. You will be notified of your successful referral and your remaining referral credits\n\n### **How to earn money by referring**\n\n- For each job posting, there’s a referral fee you can earn if the person you referred is hired\n- Referrals can be passed on: When your referral refers someone else, you can still earn a portion of the referral fee\n\n- **Referee**: The person you refer to the job ; **Referrer**: You, the person who makes the referral\n\nReferral fee cutExample\n\n| Referral fee cut | 1st degree referee candidate | 2nd degree referee candidate | 3rd degree referee candidate |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1st degree referrer | 100% | 50% | 25% |\n| 2nd degree referrer | 0% | 50% | 25% |\n| 3rd degree referrer | 0% | 0% | 50% |\n\nTo further understand the referral fee cut, below is an example if the total referral fee is PHP 10,000:\n\n| Referral fee cut | 1st degree referee candidate | 2nd degree referee candidate | 3rd degree referee candidate |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1st degree referrer | Immediate referrer (A) will receive PHP 10,000 | Immediate referrer (B) will receive PHP 5,000 | Referrer of (C) / Immediate referrer (B) will receive PHP 2,500 |\n| 2nd degree referrer | 0 | Referrer of (B) / Immediate referrer (A) will also receive PHP 5,000 | Immediate referrer (D) will receive PHP 2,500 |\n| 3rd degree referrer | 0 | 0 | Immediate referrer (C) will receive PHP 5,000 |\n\n### **How to claim your referral fee**\n\nReferring someone does not automatically guarantee you will earn money. To claim the referral fee:\n\n- The person you referred must be hired and stay in the job for a certain period.\n- If they leave before meeting the required duration, you won’t be eligible for the referral fee.\n\nSchedule options are **set by the employer** and can be seen once you tap **i** on the page.\n\n- 100% after 30 days\n- 50% after 30 days and 50% after 90 days\n- 50% after 30 days and 50% after 180 days\n- 50% after 90 days and 50% after 180 days\n\n### **Need more Help?**\n\nFor other inquiries or concerns, check out the following articles:\n\n- [How can I apply for Jobs on GCash?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/19171464377369-Apply-for-Jobs)\n- [How do I withdraw my earnings from Jobs on GCash?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/41423213263769)\n\n[Previous](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/19171464377369-How-can-I-apply-for-Jobs-on-GCash)\n\nHow can I apply for Jobs on GCash?\n\n[Next](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/23431265122969-How-do-I-refer-someone-for-Jobs-on-GCash#)\n\n- [How do I withdraw my earnings from Jobs on GCash?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/41423213263769-How-do-I-withdraw-my-earnings-from-Jobs-on-GCash)\n- [How can I apply for Jobs on GCash?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/19171464377369-How-can-I-apply-for-Jobs-on-GCash)\n- [How do I refer someone for Jobs on GCash?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/23431265122969-How-do-I-refer-someone-for-Jobs-on-GCash)\n\n23431265122969",
