Go to your GCash Card page and select the GCash Card account you want to deactivate\n2. Tap **Deactivate** located in the upper right corner\n3. Review the deactivation notice, then tap **Deactivate It**\n4. Enter your card’s 6-digit PIN to confirm.\n\nYou’ll be redirected to the GCash Card page, and your deactivated card will no longer appear.\n\n### **Need more Help?**\n\nFor other inquiries or concerns, check out the following articles:\n\n- [I can’t deactivate my GCash VISA/Mastercard Card.
