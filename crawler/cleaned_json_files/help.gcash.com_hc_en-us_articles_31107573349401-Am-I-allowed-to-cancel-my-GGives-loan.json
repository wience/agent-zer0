Coordinate with the partner merchant for your refund/GGives payment cancellation request\n2. Once everything is settled with the merchant, they can contact GCash via the dedicated support channels given to them\n\nIf your loan cancellation request is **beyond 30 calendar days from the transaction** or **the request is for a partial refund only**, the amount for refund (equal to your loan amount) will be counted as **an advance payment to your GGives loan**. You will receive any excess amount to the remaining loan in your GCash wallet.\n\n### **Need more Help?**\n\nFor other inquiries or concerns, check out the following articles:\n\n- [How can I use GGives to pay?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408130159513)\n- [How can I pay for my GGives dues?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405187569817)\n- [What happens if I pay my GGives dues in advance?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/30746472156569)\n\n[Previous](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/31107573349401-Am-I-allowed-to-cancel-my-GGives-loan#)\n\n[Next](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408119355417-How-can-I-update-my-mobile-number-for-my-GGives-account)\n\nHow can I update my mobile number for my GGives account?\n\n- [Am I allowed to cancel my GGives loan?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/31107573349401-Am-I-allowed-to-cancel-my-GGives-loan)\n- [How can I update my mobile number for my GGives account?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408119355417-How-can-I-update-my-mobile-number-for-my-GGives-account)\n- [How do I delete my GGives account?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/30751581796377-How-do-I-delete-my-GGives-account)\n\n31107573349401\n\nBack to Top",
