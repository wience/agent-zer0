See detailed information below for applicable cash or property dividend tax for local and resident foreign corporations:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Criteria** | **Final Withholding Tax** |\n| Philippine Citizen or a Resident Foreigner | 10% on the gross amount of dividends received |\n| Non-resident foreigners engaged in business or trade in the Philippines | 20% on the gross amount of dividends received |\n| Non-resident foreigner not engaged in trade or business in the Philippines | 25% on the gross amount of dividends received |\n\n**Cases where residing foreign corporation cash or property dividend tax is applicable**\n\n- **Tax Rates for Residents of Treaty Countries:** If you're from a country that has a tax treaty with the Philippines, the [tax rate on dividends](https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/philippines/individual/foreign-tax-relief-and-tax-treaties) will follow the treaty, as long as you submit all required documents.\n- **Non-Resident Foreign Corporations/Individuals:** Dividends (cash or property) from a Philippine company are usually taxed at **25%**. This can be lowered to 15% if your country allows you to claim the Philippine tax as a credit, and you submit all needed documents.\n- **Tax Treaty Rules:** If there's a tax treaty between the Philippines and your country, the treaty’s lower tax rates apply. Without a treaty, standard Philippine tax rates will be used.\n- **How to Apply for Tax Treaty Benefits:** To use the treaty’s benefits, you must submit a form (BIR Form No. 0901) at least 15 days before the transaction. Attach the required documents to explain why you qualify.\n\n**Note:** These rules apply only to taxes on dividends.\n\n### **Need more Help?**\n\nFor other inquiries or concerns, check out the following articles:\n\n- [What are the GStocks PH buy and sell fees I need to know about?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/17542731035289)\n- [Are there dividend stocks available in GStocks PH?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/31218842595353)\n- [How can I change or cancel my GStocks PH order?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/31211092525593)\n\n[Previous](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/31218842595353-Are-there-dividend-stocks-available-in-GStocks-PH)\n\nAre there dividend stocks available in GStocks PH?\n\n[Next](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/31225286057369-Can-I-transfer-stockholdings-to-another-Philippine-stock-brokerage-firm-in-GStocks-PH)\n\nCan I transfer stockholdings to another Philippine stock brokerage firm in GStocks PH?\n\n- [How can I update my account information in my GStocks PH account?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/31218818513305-How-can-I-update-my-account-information-in-my-GStocks-PH-account)\n- [Are there dividend stocks available in GStocks PH?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/31218842595353-Are-there-dividend-stocks-available-in-GStocks-PH)\n- [What are the applicable cash or property dividend taxes in GStocks PH?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/31219798745625-What-are-the-applicable-cash-or-property-dividend-taxes-in-GStocks-PH)\n- [Can I transfer stockholdings to another Philippine stock brokerage firm in GStocks PH?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/31225286057369-Can-I-transfer-stockholdings-to-another-Philippine-stock-brokerage-firm-in-GStocks-PH)\n- [How can I close my GStocks PH account?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/31259171664537-How-can-I-close-my-GStocks-PH-account)\n\n31219798745625\n\nBack to Top",
