Open the GCash app, tap **Profile**, then tap your name\n2. Tap **Update Account Information** \\> **Update your Profile**\n3. Enter the 6-digit code sent to your GCash number, then tap Next\n4. Fill in the needed information and complete the verification\n5. Submit your update\n\nYouâ€™ll get an SMS when your profile is updated. Getting an update on your verification status may take up to **3 days**.\n\nCheck out the articles below about verifying your GCash account\n\nðŸ‘‰ [Accepted IDs for GCash Verification](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/900000948786-List-of-Valid-IDs-to-get-Fully-Verified)\n\nðŸ‘‰ [My GCash account is still not verified after 3 days.
