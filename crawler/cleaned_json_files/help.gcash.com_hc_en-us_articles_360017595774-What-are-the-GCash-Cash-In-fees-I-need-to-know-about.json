Here’s a quick guide to help you understand these fees:\n\n### **Cash In via Linked Bank/Digital Wallet Account**\n\nA convenience fee will be charged for every cash in from linked accounts. The fees are as follows:\n\n| **BANK** | **FEES** | **EFFECTIVITY DATE** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| BPI | PHP 5 | October 2, 2023 |\n| UnionBank | PHP 5 | May 27, 2024 |\n| PayPal | 1% of the Cash In amount | March 4, 2024 |\n| Payoneer | 1% of the Cash In amount | October 30, 2024 |\n\n### **Cash In via Online Banking**\n\n**Bank via InstaPay**\n\nGCash is partnered with over 40 banks. You can add funds through your bank’s website or app using [InstaPay](https://www.bsp.gov.ph/PaymentAndSettlement/Instapay%20Participants.pdf). Handling fees may apply.\n\n**PayPal**\n\nYou can cash in directly from your PayPal account. [Click here](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020281973-Cash-in-via-PayPal) to know how.\n\n### **Cash In via Over-The-Counter**\n\n**FREE** for up to PHP 8,000 per month\n\n**2% fee** for any exceeding amount per month\n\n**Note**: Your FREE Cash In limit via over-the-counter outlets resets on the first day of the month.\n\nCheck out the sample computation below for over-the-counter cash in transactions:\n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **May 1**<br>You cashed in Php 7,000 over-the-counter as your first cash-in for May. <br>As you are below the limit this is **FREE** and you will receive Php 7,000 in your GCash wallet. | The month of May Cash In | 0 |\n| New Cash In Transaction | 7,000 |\n| Monthly Free Limit | 8,000 |\n| Is Transaction Above Limit? | No |\n| Amount Above Limit | 0.00 |\n| Service Fee (2%) | 0.00 |\n| Amount Credited | 7,000 |\n|  |  |  |\n| **May 5**<br>You cashed in Php 1,100.<br>Since you have already cashed in Php 7,000 before, the additional Php 1,100 would mean you’ve reached the Php 8,000 limit.<br>Only the amount above the limit, Php 100, is subject to the 2% service fee, so the computation would be: 100 x 0.02 = Php 2 service fee. | May Cash In | 7,000 |\n| New Cash In Transaction | 1,100 |\n| Monthly Free Limit | 8,000 |\n| Is Transaction Above Limit? | Yes |\n| Amount Above Limit | 100 |\n| Service Fee (2%) | 2 |\n| Total Amount Credited | 1,098 |\n|  |  |  |\n| **June 1**<br>You cashed in Php 5,000.  Since the P8,000 cash-in limit refreshes monthly, you will receive your total cash-in amount, of Php 5,000. | June Cash In | 0 |\n| New Cash In Transaction | 5,000 |\n| Monthly Free Limit | 8,000 |\n| Is Transaction Above Limit? | No |\n| Amount Above Limit | 0.00 |\n| Service Fee (2%) | 0.00 |\n| Total Amount Credited | 5,000 |\n\n### **Cash In via Remittance**\n\nCashing in via remittance is **FREE.** [Click here](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/31651143866137-Send-receive-remittance-with-GCash) to know how you can send/receive remittance with GCash.\n\nIf you have other concerns with your Cash In transactions, [click here to ask for help](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000706713&ind=normal&tf_360023219534=cash_in__i_was_charged_a_fee_for_my_cash_in_transaction.).
