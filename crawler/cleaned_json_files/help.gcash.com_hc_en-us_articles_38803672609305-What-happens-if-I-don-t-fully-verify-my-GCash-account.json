If you donâ€™t, you might face fees or your account could be closed.\n\nHereâ€™s what could happen if you donâ€™t fully verify your GCash account.\n\nLimited Access to GCash Features\n\nIf you donâ€™t fully verify your GCash account, your access will be restricted to basic services only, such as:\n\n- **Cash In**\n- **Pay Bills**\n- **Buy Load**\n- **Offline Cash-In**\n- **Receive Money**\n\nTo learn more about features with a Fully Verified GCash account, [click here](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/19576345096217-GCash-Features-for-Basic-vs-Fully-Verified-Accounts).\n\nAccount Closure\n\n**After 12 months without verification:**\n\n1. **If Your GCash Wallet Balance is Zero:**   - Your account will be **closed**\n2. **If you have money left in your GCash Wallet Balance:**   - Your account will be temporarily **suspended/restricted.** You won't be able to log in or use GCash services\n   - A monthly \" **Basic Account Maintenance Fee**\" of **PHP 15** will be applied to keep your account active in our system. This fee will continue to be charged until your wallet balance is depleted.\n   - Once your balance reaches zero, your **account will be closed**, and you will lose access to GCash.\n\nNote:\n\nThe Basic Account Maintenance Fee is **a monthly charge of PHP 15 for suspended GCash basic accounts**, effective from the date specified in the email. This fee contributes to the management of unverified accounts.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nTo use GCash again, you must [create a new GCash account](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005866623-Create-a-GCash-account) and [get fully verified.](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017722393-What-are-the-steps-to-get-a-Fully-Verified-GCash-account)\n\nIf you want to claim the funds from your deactivated GCash basic account, please follow the steps found in \"How to Claim My Funds from a Restricted Basic GCash Account.\"\n\n### Need more Help?\n\nFor other inquiries and concerns, check out the following articles.\n\nðŸ‘‰ [What are the steps to get a Fully Verified GCash account?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017722393-What-are-the-steps-to-get-a-Fully-Verified-GCash-account)\n\nðŸ‘‰ [Accepted IDs for GCash Verification](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/900000948786-Accepted-IDs-for-GCash-Verification)\n\nðŸ‘‰ [How do I claim my money from a suspended GCash Basic account?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/38827343196185-How-do-I-claim-my-money-from-a-suspended-GCash-Basic-account)\n\n[Previous](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/35141220806169-Why-did-I-receive-a-notification-to-update-my-GCash-account-information)\n\nWhy did I receive a notification to update my GCash account information?\n\n[Next](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/9386228997145-Can-I-get-fully-verified-on-GCash-offline)\n\nCan I get fully verified on GCash offline?\n\n- [What are the steps to get a Fully Verified GCash account?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017722393-What-are-the-steps-to-get-a-Fully-Verified-GCash-account)\n- [Accepted IDs for GCash Verification](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/900000948786-Accepted-IDs-for-GCash-Verification)\n- [I don't have accepted IDs for GCash verification.
