Your order is only executed **if the market price matches or exceeds your chosen price**, ensuring trades are made only at the price you set or better.\n\n### **Limit orders vs. Market orders**\n\nThere is no better option since it depends on your individual trading goals and risk tolerance. Check out the difference between market orders and limit orders below:\n\n- **Market orders** execute immediately at the best available current market price\n- **Limit orders** give you more control over the price at which you trade, but there's **no guarantee your order will be filled immediately**. Your order might not be filled if the price jumps significantly above or below your limit price before there's a matching order at your desired price. You can **set up multiple limit orders** for the same cryptocurrency, each with different target prices.\n\n### **Monitor the status of your limit orders**\n\nTrack your open limit orders through the asset dashboard, where youâ€™ll find details like price, amount, and confirmation status.\n\n### **Cancel a limit order**\n\nYou can cancel your limit order at **any time before it's filled**. This might be useful if market conditions change or you decide to adjust your trading strategy.\n\n[Previous](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/39911228301337-How-do-I-use-limit-orders-in-GCrypto#)\n\n[Next](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/31307289104153-How-do-I-check-the-status-of-my-GCrypto-order)\n\nHow do I check the status of my GCrypto order?\n\n- [How do I use limit orders in GCrypto?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/39911228301337-How-do-I-use-limit-orders-in-GCrypto)\n- [How do I check the status of my GCrypto order?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/31307289104153-How-do-I-check-the-status-of-my-GCrypto-order)\n- [How can I sell crypto in GCrypto?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/31306888871833-How-can-I-sell-crypto-in-GCrypto)\n- [What are the minimum and maximum limits for an order in GCrypto?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/31305985539865-What-are-the-minimum-and-maximum-limits-for-an-order-in-GCrypto)\n- [How can I buy crypto in GCrypto?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/9781977718425-How-can-I-buy-crypto-in-GCrypto)\n\n39911228301337\n\nBack to Top",
