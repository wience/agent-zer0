Here's how:\n\n- **Go to your phone settings.**\n- Search for **GCash** in the app list.\n- Turn off access to **Contacts**.\n- Reopen the GCash app and try using Express Send again.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to use the Express Send feature.\n\nIf you wish to grant GCash access to your contacts, you may encounter delays or temporary disruptions in using Express Send. As an alternative, you can:\n\n- **Manually copy and paste** the recipient’s mobile number.\n- **Scan or upload** the recipient’s QR code.\n\n[Previous](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/44449603684377-Advisory-on-Automated-Fuel-Dispenser-Self-Service-Gas-Pumps-Payments-using-GCash-Cards)\n\nAdvisory on Automated Fuel Dispenser (Self-Service Gas Pumps) Payments using GCash Cards\n\n[Next](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/37831595333017-GCash-Pera-Outlet-GPO-Plus-Advisory)\n\nGCash Pera Outlet (GPO) Plus Advisory\n\n- [GCash Pro Platform Termination](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/45732029791513-GCash-Pro-Platform-Termination)\n- [Advisory on Automated Fuel Dispenser (Self-Service Gas Pumps) Payments using GCash Cards](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/44449603684377-Advisory-on-Automated-Fuel-Dispenser-Self-Service-Gas-Pumps-Payments-using-GCash-Cards)\n- [Advisory for iPhone Users affected Express Send Feature Issue](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/40583772018073-Advisory-for-iPhone-Users-affected-Express-Send-Feature-Issue)\n- [GCash Pera Outlet (GPO) Plus Advisory](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/37831595333017-GCash-Pera-Outlet-GPO-Plus-Advisory)\n- [Advisory on Revenue Regulation 16-2023](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/31622004752153-Advisory-on-Revenue-Regulation-16-2023)\n- [Advisory for using GCash on iPhone with iOS 13 and Below](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/26245453156633-Advisory-for-using-GCash-on-iPhone-with-iOS-13-and-Below)\n- [Shift of SMS messages to GCash App Inbox](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/10040298426137-Shift-of-SMS-messages-to-GCash-App-Inbox)\n- [GCash Updated Terms and Conditions](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/22717341874585-GCash-Updated-Terms-and-Conditions)\n\n40583772018073\n\nBack to Top",
