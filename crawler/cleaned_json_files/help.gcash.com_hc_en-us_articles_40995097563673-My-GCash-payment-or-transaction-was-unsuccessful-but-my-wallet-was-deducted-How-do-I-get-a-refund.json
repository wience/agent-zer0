Then, check if your GCash wallet balance had any deductions.\n\nIf the transaction doesn’t appear in your Transaction History and there’s no wallet deduction, it means the transaction was unsuccessful and didn’t go through.\n\nSome transactions may take time to process. This means your GCash wallet will be deducted right away, but our partners may need extra time to complete and post/process the transaction. Here are the services with processing times:\n\n- **Bills** \\- Depends on the biller. You can view the full list of [Partner Billers and processing times here](https://new.gcash.com/partners/billers).\n- **GFunds** \\- Check out the Order Processing Days for GFunds [here](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/900004505746-Order-processing-days-for-GFunds-transactions).\n- **GStocks PH** \\- Buy/Sell Orders will be posted to PSE immediately but will be processed during Trading Hours.\n  - Trading Hours:\n    - Mon- Fri (excluding holidays)\n    - 9AM - 12PM and 1PM - 3PM\n- **GCrypto** \\- Buy/Sell Orders will be **in real-time.**\n\nIf there is no record in your Transaction History but your account balance was deducted, we may need to look into this further.
