The more you use GCash, the lower your interest rate could be.\n\n### **GCredit Interest Charges**\n\nInterest charges **start the day after a transaction is made** using GCredit.\n\nThe interest is calculated based on the number of days the amount is borrowed.\n\n### **How to calculate GCredit interest rate**\n\nRefer to the example below to calculate your GCredit interest rate.\n\n1. **Transaction Date:** October 1\n2. **Amount Borrowed:** PHP 1,000\n3. **Interest Rate:** 5%\n4. **Payment Date:** October 10\n\n**Interest Calculation:**\n\n- Number of days borrowed: 9 days (October 2 to October 10)\n- Daily interest rate:Â  5% monthly rate/ 30 days = 0.17% per day\n\n\n**Total interest:** PHP 1,000 \\* 0.17% \\* 9 days = **PHP 15**\n\n**Total Outstanding Balance:** PHP 1,000 (principal) + PHP 15 (interest) =\n\n**PHP 1,015.00**\n\nNote:\n\nIf the GCredit dues are paid within the same day of the transaction, no interest charges will be applied.\n\n### **Need more Help?**\n\nFor other inquiries or concerns, check out the following articles:\n\n- [How much can I borrow with GCredit?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/31112186199449)\n- [How can I increase my GCredit limit?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038859593)\n- [How can I use GCredit to pay?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038858973)\n\n[Previous](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/31112602155033-Can-I-apply-for-GCredit)\n\nCan I apply for GCredit?\n\n[Next](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038858973-How-can-I-use-GCredit-to-pay)\n\nHow can I use GCredit to pay?\n\n- [How much can I borrow with GCredit?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/31112186199449-How-much-can-I-borrow-with-GCredit)\n- [Can I apply for GCredit?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/31112602155033-Can-I-apply-for-GCredit)\n- [What are the interest rates in GCredit?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403265843225-What-are-the-interest-rates-in-GCredit)\n- [How can I use GCredit to pay?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038858973-How-can-I-use-GCredit-to-pay)\n- [How can I increase my GCredit limit?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038859593-How-can-I-increase-my-GCredit-limit)\n\n4403265843225\n\nBack to Top",
