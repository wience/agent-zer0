Think of it as a bonus for investing your money. These payments can give you extra income besides your investment’s value.\n\nIf you invest in a fund that makes money, it might share some of its profit with you as dividends. **However, not all funds pay dividends.**\n\nHere’s what you should know about dividends:\n\n- **Not guaranteed** The amount you get may change each month. Some months might have higher payouts, while others might have none.\n- **Non-cumulative** If you don’t get dividends in a certain month, the fund won’t make up for it later. Each month’s payout is separate.\n\n### **Sample of how dividends are computed:**\n\nThe number of fund units you have as of Record date x Unit Dividend x NAVPU as of Record date\n\n= **Dividends Received**\n\nNote: The number of units and NAVPU considered are only the ones received during the record date, not during the settlement date. The fund manager determines the record date and NAVPU.\n\nThe unit dividend is rounded to **4 units.**\n\nSee a sample dividend computation below:\n\n| **Item** | **Value** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Number of Units (as of Record Date) | 10,000 units |\n| Unit Dividend | 0.0035 |\n| NAVPU (as of Record Date) | PHP 120.50 |\n| Dividends Received | PHP 4,217.50 |\n\nIf you don’t get your dividends **2–3 days** after the expected date, [click here to ask for help](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000706713&ind=normal&tf_360023219534=gfunds__i_have_a_problem_with_my_gfunds_transaction&tf_22405932372249=gfunds_dividends).\n\n### **Need more Help?**\n\nFor other inquiries or concerns, check out the following articles:\n\n- [I can’t buy or sell in GFunds.
