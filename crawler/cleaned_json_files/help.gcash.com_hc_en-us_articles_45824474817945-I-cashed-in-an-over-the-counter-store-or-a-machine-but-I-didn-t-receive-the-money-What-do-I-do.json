Try checking your Transaction History at a later time.\n2. **Verify if the mobile number for the transaction is correct**   - You might’ve sent it to the wrong GCash account. Double-check if you have entered the correct mobile number. You are responsible for sending money to the correct number.\n3. **Check if you haven’t exceeded your wallet limits**   - Each GCash wallet account has a monthly limit. In case you exceed this limit, your transaction will not proceed and an error will occur. Learn more about [GCash Wallet and Transaction Limits here](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021112894-What-are-my-GCash-Wallet-and-Transaction-Limits).\n4. **Check if you saw an error in the machine**   - If there's a person at the cashier or counter, ask for assistance. They should know what to do with the error. If they can’t help or if there’s no one to assist, please take a photo of the error message and contact us.\n\nIf you followed the steps above or they aren’t applicable and you still haven’t received the money, [click here to ask for help](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ind=normal&tf_360023219534=cash_in__i_didn_t_receive_my_money_after_cashing_in_via_otc&ticket_form_id=360000706713).
