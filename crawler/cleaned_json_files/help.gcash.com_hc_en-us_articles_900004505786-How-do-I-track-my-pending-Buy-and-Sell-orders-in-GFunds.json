Here’s how:\n\n1. On your **GFunds Dashboard**, tap **View Pending Orders**\n2. Select the details of your chosen order\n\nAfter placing your order, you’ll be directed to a page showing its **current status**. Refer to the table below to learn about the possible statuses your GFunds orders can have:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Order Status** | **Description** |\n| Your Order is being processed | Your Order has been successfully placed and is currently being processed. |\n| Your Order is Complete | Your Order has been completed, and the changes should be reflected in your GFunds dashboard. |\n| Your Order is Cancelled by the System or Partner | Your Order has been successfully cancelled. You’ll no longer be able to track this order. |\n\n**What Happens If Your GFunds Order Is Cancelled?**\n\n- **Buy Order**: The amount will be refunded to your GCash wallet within **2-3 business days.**\n- **Sell Order**: The funds will stay in your GFunds balance since no fund movement occurred.\n\n### **Need more Help?**\n\nFor other inquiries or concerns, check out the following articles:\n\n- [When will I receive my GFunds Buy or Sell orders?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/900004505746-Order-processing-days-for-GFunds-transactions)\n- [My Buy Order has not been reflected in my GFunds account.
