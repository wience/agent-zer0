The email will have details of the Scan to Pay QR product, the documents required, and how to upload the documents via Google form. You will also receive a Zoom invite to the weekly webinars which are arranged by the Acquisition team.\n4. For approved and processed applications, you will receive a QR Kit, which contains the following:\n\n\n   - QR standee\n   - Cellphone with Globe SIM Card (Do NOT register the SIM to GCash)\n   - Door hanger\n   - Guide or instructions\n\n## Application Timelines\n\n| **Business Day** | **Process** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Day 1 | Complete Document Submission including signed MOA |\n| Day 2 | Review of application |\n| Day 3 | QR wallet creation |\n| Day 4-6 | QR production and kitting |\n| Day 7-11 | Delivery (NCR area) |\n| Day 7-14 | Delivery (Provincial area) |\n\nIf your application is **returned**, you might need to submit additional documents. Remember, resubmitting will **restart the application timeline from day 1.**\n\n## Accepting QR Payments\n\nYou can start accepting payments as soon as your QR kit is delivered and set up in your store. Customers can pay by scanning your QR code or showing their personal QR code for you to scan.\n\nHere are some reminders about accepting QR payments:\n\n- You don’t need an internet connection to accept GCash payments. A phone that receives SMS notifications, included in your QR kit, is enough to confirm payments.\n- All payments, including those made via GCredit, GGives, or vouchers, are **credited in full to the merchant’s virtual wallet in real-time**.\n- GCash will **automatically transfer funds to the merchant’s nominated bank account** for all successful transactions by the next banking day. An SMS confirmation will be sent after each successful transaction.\n- Transaction or settlement reports will be emailed within **24 hours**. You can use these reports to check and verify your GCash transactions.\n\nIf your QR keycard or phone/SIM card is lost or damaged, email **merchantsupport@gcash.com** to request a replacement. Delivery will take **7–11 days**, depending on your branch's location.\n\n## Need more help?\n\n#### Issues related to payments\n\n| **CUSTOMER CONCERNS** |\n| --- |\n| Issue | Process | Solution and SLA |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| The customer is unable to pay via RQR.
