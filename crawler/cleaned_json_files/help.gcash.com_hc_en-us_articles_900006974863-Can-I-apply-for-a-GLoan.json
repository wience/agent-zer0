Why is that?** **A:** Thank you for being a loyal GCash user! GLoan offers are based on several factors such as your GScore, overall account activity, and system evaluation. While long-term usage is valuable, it does not automatically guarantee eligibility. Your account is reviewed regularly, and eligibility may change over time.\n\n**Q: I was eligible before, but now I’m not. Why?** **A:** GLoan availability can change depending on your latest system assessment. This does not mean you are permanently ineligible — your eligibility is reviewed regularly, and the offer may return.\n\n**Q: My GScore is high, but why am I still not eligible?** **A:** GScore is only one of the many factors considered in evaluating your GLoan eligibility. The system also reviews your usage patterns, repayment history, and other internal criteria. A high GScore does not guarantee an offer. GLoan is currently offered only to pre-selected users. You’ll know you’re eligible if you receive an SMS from us.\n\n**Q: Is there a way to unlock GLoan eligibility faster?** **A:** GLoan offers are system-generated and cannot be manually unlocked or expedited. The best way to increase your chances is to stay active on GCash and keep your account information updated.\n\n**Q: Why do others have a lower GScore than I do, but they are eligible and I’m not?** **A:** Every user has a different profile. GLoan eligibility considers more than just GScore — including various other system-evaluated factors. Rest assured, your account is reviewed regularly.\n\n**Q: Why is my GLoan limit low? Can I request to increase it?** **A:** Your GLoan credit limit is auto-generated based on your account profile and system evaluation. It cannot be manually adjusted. However, good repayment behavior and continued account activity may help your limit increase over time.\n\n**Q: Why did my GLoan credit limit change or not increase even though I pay on time?** **A:** Thank you for paying on time! While repayment behavior is important, your credit limit is affected by several other factors evaluated by the system. Your profile is reviewed periodically, so your limit may still improve.\n\n**Q: I have multiple GCash mobile numbers. Why can’t I apply for GLoan using my other numbers?** **A:** GLoan is limited to one active account per user. If you have multiple GCash numbers, you can only access or apply for GLoan through the number linked to your current loan. If you’re getting an error when using another number, it may be because you still have an active GLoan tied to a different account. To apply using a new number, please fully settle your existing loan first.\n\n**Q: I’ve been using GCash actively, so why is it still hard to become eligible for GLoan?** **A:** We understand your concern. GLoan eligibility is determined by multiple dynamic factors beyond app usage duration. Remaining active and maintaining good account standing increases your chances of being selected.\n\n### **Need more Help?**\n\nFor other inquiries or concerns, check out the following articles:\n\n- [How much can I borrow with GLoan?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005986946)\n- [What are the GLoan fees I need to know about?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/6145865592985)\n- [Why am I not eligible for GLoan?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/39388172019353)\n- [I cannot apply to GLoan.
