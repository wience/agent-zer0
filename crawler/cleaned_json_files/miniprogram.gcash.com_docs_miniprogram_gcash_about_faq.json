However, it's difficult to define the size limit of the source code because many factors impact the size of the packaged source code, such as image compressing. Currently the package for debugging on real devices has the maximum size. The file is stored in the directory as highlighted in the following figure. Except for this file, generally all files that are no more than 8MB can be uploaded.\n\n![image.png](https://ac.alipay.com/storage/2020/5/11/793a3d8d-5270-405b-9362-e6a670b9c842.png)\n\n## Basic information\n\n**Does the mini program support SVG and gradient?**\n\nYes.
