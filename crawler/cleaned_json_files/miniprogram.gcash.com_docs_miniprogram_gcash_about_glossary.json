It is a JavaScript standard meant to ensure the interoperability of Web pages across different Web browsers.\n\n# F\n\n## front-end running\n\nThe status when a Mini Program runs in the front end after a user opens the Mini Program for the first time.\n\n# H\n\n## hot startup\n\nA hot startup is the startup when a user opens a Mini Program that has been opened but is running in back end.\n\n## HTML\n\nAn application of the Standard Generalized Markup Language that uses tags to mark elements, such as text and graphics, in a document to indicate how Web browsers should display these elements to the user and should respond to user actions.\n\n# I\n\n## IDE\n\nIDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger. The IDE for Mini Program development is called Mini Program Studio.\n\n## iOS\n\niOS (formerly iPhone OS) is a mobile operating system that is created and developed by Apple Inc. exclusively for its hardware.\n\n## ISV\n\nISV (Independent Software Vendor) is an individual or organization that develops, markets, and sells software solutions that run on one or more computer hardware providers like Macintosh, operating systems like iOS, or cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services. In a Mini Program, ISV usually act as the third-party service developer to develop and operate the Mini Program on behalf of merchants.\n\n## icon\n\nA pictogram used on the user interface to assist with navigation.\n\n# J\n\n## JS\n\nJS (Java Scripting) is a scripting language that is used by Web page authors in designing interactive sites. It can interact with HTML source code, enabling Web developers to enhance their websites with dynamic content.\n\n## JSON\n\nJSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate.\n\n## JSAPI\n\nJSAPI is the client-side (front-end) API of Mini Programs. It can be divided into 14 categories according to the functions that can be realized, including interface, multimedia, cache, file, location, network, equipment, data security, sharing, collection, custom general menu, the type of small program currently running version, custom analysis, and update management.\n\n# L\n\n## lifecycle\n\nLifecycle is the life and death of an object. It usually refers to the process by which a program is created, started, paused, evoked, stopped, and uninstalled. The lifecycle of a Mini Program can be divided into application lifecycle and page lifecycle.\n\n# M\n\n## mini program\n\nMini Programs are sub-applications that run inside an mobile app.\n\n## mini program component\n\nMini program components are mini program view controls which allow developers to combine components for development.\n\n## mini program framework\n\nThe Mini Program is divided into two layers: `app` and `page`.
