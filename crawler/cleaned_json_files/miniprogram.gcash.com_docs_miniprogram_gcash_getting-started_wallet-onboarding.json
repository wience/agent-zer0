Contact us to create a Mini Program workspace for your app.\n\nIn order for us to create a workspace, you're required to provide the following:\n\n1. Your valid business license and point of contact\n2. Your APK signature, bundle ID, and package name\n\n2. Customize your workspace.\n\nOnce your Mini Program workspace creation request is approved, you will receive a dedicated URL to access your workspace in the Mini Program Platform.You then make the following configuration settings:\n\n1. Replace the default URL to your business domain by configuring a reverse proxy server.\n2. Customize the UI by replacing the default logo/favicon with your preferred logo.\n3. Customize the email service.\n\n3. Integrate the SDK (Android and iOS).\n\nDownload the configuration guide from your Platform and follow the steps in this guide to initialize the SDK. For more information, see _AC SDK Integration Guide_.\n\n4. Implement the standard JSAPIs.\n\nWhile the SDK provides you with the core Mini Program functionality, you can get enhanced features with a customized implementation of standard JSAPIs. For instance, when a Mini Program invokes the payment function, you are recommended to launch the existing standard payment flow instead of a completely new one. For more information, see [JSAPIs](https://miniprogram.gcash.com/docs/miniprogram_gcash/mpdev/api_overview).\n\n5. Implement the standard Open APIs.\n\nIn addition to the client-side JSAPIs, you also need to implement the server-side APIs, in order to enable the capabilities, such as OAuth and Payment. For more information, see [Open APIs](https://miniprogram.gcash.com/docs/miniprogram_gcash/mpdev/openapi_overview).\n\nNow you can start using the Mini Program Platform.\n\n# Next steps\n\n[Merchant onboarding](https://miniprogram.gcash.com/docs/miniprogram_gcash/getting-started/merchant-on-boarding)\n\n# Contact us\n\nIf you're interested in using Mini Programs and the Mini Program Platform, please send us an email.",
