Please debug in the production environment.\n\n- For Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and Android devices, the device ID is the MAC address of the device; for iOS devie, the device ID is the UUID of the device. Therefore, do not hard code the device ID. You need to process the device ID on different platforms; iOS devices can be dynamically matched based on properties such as localName, advertisData, and manufacturerData.\n\n**Note:**\n\nCurrently simulation in IDE is not supported. Please debug in the production environment.\n\n## Code Sample\n\ncopy\n\n```javascript\nmy.getBluetoothDevices({\n  success: (res) => {\n    console.log(res)\n  },\n  fail:(res) => {\n  },\n  complete: (res)=>{\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## Parameters\n\nThe input parameters are displayed in the following table:\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Property** | **Type** | **Required** | **Description** |\n| success | Function | No | The callback function for a successful API call. |\n| fail | Function | No | The callback function for a failed API call. |\n| complete | Function | No | The callback function for a completed API call (Regardless of whether the call is successful or not). |\n\n### Success Callback Function\n\nThe input parameters are displayed in the following table:\n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Property** | **Type** | **Description** |\n| devices | Array | A list of all the devices that are discovered. |\n\n#### Device Object\n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Property** | **Type** | **Description** |\n| name | String | Name of the bluetooth device.(For some devices, there's no name.) |\n| deviceName(Compatibal with initial version) | String | Name of the bluetooth device. |\n| localName | String | Name of the local device. |\n| deviceId | String | Device ID |\n| RSSI | Number | Received Signal Strength Indicator |\n| advertisData | Hex String | Advertisement data of the device |\n| manufacturerData | Hex String | Manufacturer data of the device |",
