Please debug in the production environment.\n\n## Code Sample\n\ncopy\n\n```javascript\nmy.offBluetoothDeviceFound();\n```\n\n## Transmitting Callback Values\n\n- If you don't transmit the callback value, all the event listener callbacks will be removed. See the below code sample for more information:\n\n\n\ncopy\n\n\n\n```javascript\nmy.offBluetoothDeviceFoun();\n```\n\n\n- If you transmit the callback value, the corresponding callbacks will be removed. See the below code sample for more information:\n\n\n\ncopy\n\n\n\n```javascript\nmy.offBluetoothDeviceFoun(this.callback);\n```",
