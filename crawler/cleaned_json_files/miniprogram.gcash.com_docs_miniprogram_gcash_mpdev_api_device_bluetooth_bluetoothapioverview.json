You can then find an overview of all the bluetooth APIs and a sample of code snippet. In addition, you can refer to the FAQ and error code table for more details.\n\n## System Requirement\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Bluetooth Type** | **System Requirement** |\n| Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) | Android: 5.0 and upper versions<br>iOS: no requirements |\n\n## Process Flow\n\nThe following diagram illustrates how the bluetooth function is enabled with APIs. You can see the details on how each API works.\n\n### BLE\n\n![Bluetooth API
