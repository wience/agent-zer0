This is an open service that captures basic user information such as avatar, nickname, gender, and region after obtaining the user's authorization.\n\n## Requirements\n\nWhen obtaining basic user information, mini program developers must meet the following requirements:\n\n- Do not guide users to grant authorization at the launch of the mini program. Users have the right to fully understand the mini program and its operations before giving any authorization.\n- Do not obtain the user ID and the user's real name. The information to obtain can only include basic user information, such as user avatar, nickname, gender, and location.\n- As the basic user information and the user's mobile phone number are obtained by two JSAPIs, these two kinds of information cannot be requested in the same modal.\n- Do not obtain user information that is not related to the business. If the user does not grant authorization at the first request, display the modal to allow the user to reverse the decision when the business requires the authorization again.\n\n## Procedures\n\nTo obtain the user's basic information in the mini program, mini program developers must complete the following steps:\n\n### Step 1: Create a mini program\n\n[Apply for an account](https://miniprogram.gcash.com/docs/miniprogram_gcash/mpdev/quick-start_create-account) and [create a mini program](https://miniprogram.gcash.com/docs/miniprogram_gcash/mpdev/quick-start_try-mini-program-demo) on the Mini Program Platform.\n\n### Step 2: Add the feature\n\nEnter the mini program you just created. Click the \" **Features**\" tab, then \" **Add Feature**\" to pop up the feature list. Tick \"obtain basic member information\" and click the \"Confirm\" button to activate the feature.\n\n![image](https://gw.alipayobjects.com/mdn/rms_150082/afts/img/A*9cfOTIAalDoAAAAAAAAAAABkARQnAQ)\n\n### Step 3: Call the JSAPI\n\nCall the [my.getOpenUserInfo](https://miniprogram.gcash.com/docs/miniprogram_gcash/mpdev/api_openapi_getopenuserinfo) JSAPI to obtain the user's basic information.\n\n**Note:**\n\nDevelopers must consider the possibility that users reject to authorize the mini program to collect their information. In such cases, developers must have corresponding solutions, such as guiding users to manually fill in or upload their information.\n\n#### Display the authorization modal\n\nIn the [button component](https://miniprogram.gcash.com/docs/miniprogram_gcash/mpdev/component_form-component_button), set the value of `open-type` as `getAuthorize` and set the value of `scope` as `userInfo`.\n\n**Sample code:**\n\ncopy\n\n```javascript\n<!-- .axml -->\n<button\n    open-type=\"getAuthorize\"\n    onGetAuthorize=\"onGetAuthorize\"\n    onError=\"onAuthError\"\n    scope='userInfo'>\n</button>\n```\n\n**Button properties**\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Name** | **Description** |\n| open-type | The value is `getAuthorize`. |\n| scope | The value is `userInfo`. |\n| onGetAuthorize | Authorization success callback. The mini program can call `my.getOpenUserInfo` to get information in this callback. |\n| onError | Authorization failure callback, including user rejection and system errors. |\n\n#### Call the my.getOpenUserInfo JSAPI\n\nAfter the user grants the authorization, the mini program can call the [my.getOpenUserInfo](https://miniprogram.gcash.com/docs/miniprogram_gcash/mpdev/api_openapi_getopenuserinfo) JSAPI to obtain basic user information.\n\n**Sample code:**\n\ncopy\n\n```javascript\n// .js\nonGetAuthorize(res) {\n    my.getOpenUserInfo({\n        fail: (res) => {\n        },\n        success: (res) => {\n            let userInfo = JSON.parse(res.response).response\n        }\n    });\n}\n```\n\n**Sample of a successfully returned message format:**\n\ncopy\n\n```javascript\n{\n    \"response\":{\n        \"response\":{\n            \"code\":\"10000\",\n            \"msg\":\"Success\",\n            \"countryCode\":\"code\",\n            \"gender\":\"f\",\n            \"nickName\":\"XXX\",\n            \"avatar\":\"https://image_domain/images/partner/XXXXXXXX\",\n            \"city\":\"city\",\n            \"province\":\"province\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## API list\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **JSAPI** | **Description** |\n| [my.getAuthCode](https://miniprogram.gcash.com/docs/miniprogram_gcash/mpdev/api_openapi_getauthcode) | Gets user's authorization code. |\n| [my.getOpenUserInfo](https://miniprogram.gcash.com/docs/miniprogram_gcash/mpdev/api_openapi_getopenuserinfo) | Gets basic user information. |\n\n## FAQs\n\n**1\\. Can the function of obtaining basic user information be used to obtain the wallet** `userId` **?**\n\nNo. If mini programs need to obtain the user ID, see [user authorization](https://miniprogram.gcash.com/docs/miniprogram_gcash/mpdev/api_openapi_userauthorization) for details and call [my.getAuthCode](https://miniprogram.gcash.com/docs/miniprogram_gcash/mpdev/api_openapi_getauthcode) to get the user ID.\n\n**2\\. Can mini programs obtain the user's mobile phone number, avatar, nickname, and other public information at the same time?**\n\nNo. Mini programs cannot obtain the user's mobile phone number, avatar, nickname at the same time in the same modal.\n\nThe following public user information can be obtained with [my.getOpenUserInfo](https://miniprogram.gcash.com/docs/miniprogram_gcash/mpdev/api_openapi_getopenuserinfo):\n\n- Avatar\n- Nickname\n- Gender\n- Country\n\nThe following private user information can be obtained with [my.getAuthCode](https://miniprogram.gcash.com/docs/miniprogram_gcash/mpdev/api_openapi_getauthcode):\n\n- User ID\n- Phone number\n\n**3\\. Can mini programs get user ID, real name, and private information through the function of obtaining basic user information?**\n\nNo. Through the function of obtaining basic user information, mini programs can only get user avatar, nickname, gender, location, and other public information.",
