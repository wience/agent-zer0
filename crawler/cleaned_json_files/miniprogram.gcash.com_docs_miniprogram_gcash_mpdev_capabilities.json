For example, the payment capability is accomplished by the `my.tradePay` JSAPI and OpenAPIs such as `/{version}/payments/pay` and `/{version}/payments/notifyPayment`, where the `version` is `v1` or `v2`.\n\n# Architecture overview\n\nThe calling process of JSAPIs and OpenAPIs is illustrated as below:\n\n![1592813389824-fe820e10-a1b3-468c-b01f-8654f4493aef.png](https://ac.alipay.com/storage/2020/5/11/793a3d8d-5270-405b-9362-e6a670b9c842.png)\n\n## JSAPI\n\nJSAPIs are available by default in the mini program container. You can call the existing JSAPIs from the mini program to use. When you call a JSAPI, it will interact between the wallet and the merchant or ISV backend server.\n\n## OpenAPI\n\nACL (Access Control List) OpenAPI standards are available. You can also use the standards of OpenAPIs and define the OpenAPIs. When you call an OpenAPI, it will interact between the wallet and the merchant or ISV backend server.\n\nWith a combination of JSAPIs and OpenAPIs, a set of capabilities can be defined. For example, you can see the following capabilities that are available by default:\n\n- [User information capability](https://miniprogram.gcash.com/docs/miniprogram_gcash/mpdev/capability-user-information)\n- [Payment capability](https://miniprogram.gcash.com/docs/miniprogram_gcash/mpdev/capability-payment)\n- For all OpenAPIs that support various capabilities, see [OpenAPIs for Merchants](https://miniprogram.gcash.com/docs/miniprogram_gcash/mpdev/openapi_overview).\n\nIn addition, you can define your own features that are centrally managed in the workspace of the Mini Program Platform. You can select the JSAPIs that are available by default. For more information, see [Features](https://miniprogram.gcash.com/docs/miniprogram_gcash/platform/feature).\n\n# More information\n\n[JSAPIs](https://miniprogram.gcash.com/docs/miniprogram_gcash/mpdev/api_overview)\n\n[Open APIs](https://miniprogram.gcash.com/docs/miniprogram_gcash/mpdev/openapi_overview)\n\n[Using Mini Program Platform](https://miniprogram.gcash.com/docs/miniprogram_gcash/platform/overview)\n\n[Features](https://miniprogram.gcash.com/docs/miniprogram_gcash/platform/feature)",
