You can use error codes and messages to troublshoot issues.\n\nError codes are usually classified into the following categories:\n\n- [Common error codes](https://miniprogram.gcash.com/docs/miniprogram_gcash/mpdev/error_codesv2#oyy9K): are common for all Mini Program OpenAPIs.\n- [API-specific error codes](https://miniprogram.gcash.com/docs/miniprogram_gcash/mpdev/error_codesv2#yXcm4): are dedicated to a specific OpenAPI.\n\n# Common error codes\n\nThe following table lists all common error codes for Mini Program OpenAPIs. If you do not find an error code in the following table, it means that the error code is not common, but dedicated to a specific OpenAPI.\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Error code** | **Result status** | **Error message** | **Further action** |\n| PROCESS\\_FAIL | F | A general business failure occurred. Do not retry. | Contact technical support to troubleshoot the issue. |\n| PARAM\\_ILLEGAL | F | Illegal parameters. For example, non-numeric input, invalid date. | Check and verify whether the request fields (including the header fields  and body fields) of the current API are correct and valid. For example, [/v1/authorizations/applyToken](https://miniprogram.gcash.com/docs/miniprogram_gcash/mpdev/qfd7r1). |\n| INVALID\\_API | F | The called API is invalid or not active. | Check whether the current API name is used by mistakes when the API is called. |\n| ACCESS\\_DENIED | F | Access is denied | Need to check the _resultMessage_ of the current API specification for details. For example, [/v1/authorizations/applyToken](https://miniprogram.gcash.com/docs/miniprogram_gcash/mpdev/qfd7r1). |\n| REQUEST\\_TRAFFIC\\_EXCEED\\_LIMIT | F | The request traffic exceeds the limit. | - The party that calls APIs needs to reduce the API calling frequency, or<br>- The API service provider needs to increase the traffic limit or threshold. |\n| UNKNOWN\\_EXCEPTION | U | An API calling is failed, which is caused by unknown reasons. | Trying to recall the API might help to resolve the issue. |\n\n# API-specific error codes\n\nFor error codes that are dedicated to a specific API, see the **Error codes** section in each API specification, for example, [/v1/authorizations/applyToken](https://miniprogram.gcash.com/docs/miniprogram_gcash/mpdev/qfd7r1).",
