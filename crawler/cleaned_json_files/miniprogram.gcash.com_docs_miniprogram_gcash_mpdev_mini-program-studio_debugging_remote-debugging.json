With the remote real machine debugging, you can:\n\n- Perform breakpoint debugging of remote Mini Program in IDE\n\n- View the AXML structure and style of remote interface in IDE\n\n- View cellphone's network, storage and other information in IDE\n\n- View Mini Program running log on cellphone in IDE\n\nClick Debug in the top-right toolbar and confirm to push and generate debugging QR code:\n\n![Remote Debugging](https://gw.alipayobjects.com/mdn/rms_5158ba/afts/img/A*yiQ0QKmslh8AAAAAAAAAAAAAARQnAQ#align=left&display=inline&height=1622&margin=%5Bobject%20Object%5D&originHeight=1622&originWidth=2880&status=done&style=stroke&width=2880)\n\nAfter scanning with the app, the simulator shows the connection information. Meanwhile the cellphone shows the remote debugging mode has been connected. Now you can open the `DevTool` window to debug.\n\n![Remote Debugging](https://ac.alipay.com/storage/2020/5/11/793a3d8d-5270-405b-9362-e6a670b9c842.png)\n\nFor example, you can normally inspect axml elements.\n\nAnd you can perform break point debugging. Just select the `Sources` tab of the devtool, and then choose the specific js file. You can simple click the line number to add break point or right click the line number to show the break point prompt and then add a conditional break point. If the break point hits, the break pint line will become blue and there will be a hint in the phone showing break point hits.\n\n![Remote Debugging](https://ac.alipay.com/storage/2020/5/11/793a3d8d-5270-405b-9362-e6a670b9c842.png)\n\nAttention in the remote debugging: make sure to disconnect remote debugging after modifying code each time, and then push again, repeat the steps to scan to connect and perform remote debugging.\n\n九色鹿",
