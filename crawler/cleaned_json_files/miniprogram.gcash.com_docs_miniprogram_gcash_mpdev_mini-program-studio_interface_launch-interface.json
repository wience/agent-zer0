For more information, see [Apply for an Account](https://miniprogram.gcash.com/docs/miniprogram_gcash/mpdev/quick-start_create-account).\n\n# Features\n\nWhen you launch the Mini Program Studio, you can do the following tasks in the user interface.\n\n- Login\n\n- Joined workspaces\n\n- Create a new Mini Program\n\n- Open an existing Mini Program\n\n- Delete a Mini Program\n\nFor more information, see the demos below:\n\n## Login\n\nThe first time opening the Mini Program Studio, login is required. You can use the account that applied from Mini Program Developer Portal to login the Mini Program.\n\n![image](https://gw.alipayobjects.com/mdn/rms_5158ba/afts/img/A*zG17SYZZeSMAAAAAAAAAAAAAARQnAQ)\n\nIf password is forgot, try to retrieve the password in the [Mini Program Developer Portal](https://miniprogram.gcash.com/forgotpassword).\n\n## Joined Workspaces\n\nAfter login, you can see which workspaces you have joined in the left side of the launch interface.\n\n![image](https://gw.alipayobjects.com/mdn/rms_5158ba/afts/img/A*zaBnQazpx4gAAAAAAAAAAAAAARQnAQ)\n\nA developer can join multiple workspaces by invitation of workspace admins, and Mini Programs are separated in different workspaces. So here you can develop different Mini Program project for different workspaces.\n\n## Create a New Mini Program\n\nThe first time opening the Mini Program, you can create a new Mini Program project. The Mini Program Studio has provided two ways to create a new Mini Program:\n\n- Creating a Mini Program scaffold project, it contains basic files of a Mini Program.\n\n- Creating a Mini Program from the provided templates, which provides the template codes and help you to complete the Mini Program quickly.\n\n### Creating Scaffold Project\n\nBy clicking the `Add card` in the launch interface, you can create a scaffold project. In the project setup page, you need to set up following properties:\n\n- Project Name: Project name to be displayed in the Mini Program Studio. Space is not allowed in the name. We recommend you to use letters to set the a meaning name.\n\n- Project Path: Location for saving the project in the disk.\n\nAfter the setup of the properties, click the complete button to complete the creating of the Mini Program.\n\n![image](https://gw.alipayobjects.com/mdn/rms_5158ba/afts/img/A*XmsJQ5RPQIkAAAAAAAAAAAAAARQnAQ)\n\n### Creating Template Project\n\nIn the launch interface, there is a `templates` button. Click it, you can see there are three templates and there will be more templates in the future.\n\n![image](https://gw.alipayobjects.com/mdn/rms_5158ba/afts/img/A*HN6WR7Qyjx0AAAAAAAAAAAAAARQnAQ)\n\nChoose a template then click `Next`. Then similar with creating a new Mini Program, set the name and path for the project and click `Complete` button to complete the creation process.\n\n## Open an Existing Mini Program\n\nIf you have created Mini Program project before, or you have a local Mini Program project which may from a git source, you can open it with the `Open Project` function.\n\n### Open Local Project\n\nAfter clicking the `Open Project` button, a local selector will pop up, you need to select the root path of your local Mini Program project and then confirm the selection.\n\n![image](https://gw.alipayobjects.com/mdn/rms_5158ba/afts/img/A*e4UwTI6i-oQAAAAAAAAAAAAAARQnAQ)\n\n### Open Recent Opened Project\n\nIf you have opened a Mini Program project before, it will show in the launch interface. You can click the card to open the project directly.\n\n## Delete Project\n\nIf you do not want the launch interface to show too many opened projects, you can right click the project card and then a delete popup will show, then you can remove it from the launch interface to make the interface clean.\n\n![image](https://gw.alipayobjects.com/mdn/rms_5158ba/afts/img/A*K050QIdtY74AAAAAAAAAAAAAARQnAQ)\n\n> Note: the delete function will not remove the local project files, only remove the entries in the launch interface.",
