Firstly, you need to associate the project to a created Mini Program.\n\n2. Online version or current uploaded version: For easy management, each upload has an incremental version. You can define your own versioning rule.\n\nNext, click `Upload`. As the volume of the Mini Program should not exceeds 2048 KB, if it is above the volume limit, a prompt will be displayed. We suggest you to reduce resources to reduce the volume.",
