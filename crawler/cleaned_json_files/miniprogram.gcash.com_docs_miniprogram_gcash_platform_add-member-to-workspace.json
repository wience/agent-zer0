After onboarding on Mini Program Platform, the wallet and merchants can add members to collaborate to manage their workspaces.\n\nFor members who have permission to add members to workspaces, see the following figure:\n\n![image](https://ac.alipay.com/storage/2020/5/11/793a3d8d-5270-405b-9362-e6a670b9c842.png)\n\n- Wallet: Only workspace admins have permission to add members to their workspaces.\n- Merchant: Only developer admins have permission to add members to their workspaces.\n\n## Procedures\n\nTo add members to a workspace, you can follow the steps below:\n\n### Step 1: Navigate to Members tab\n\nLog in to the platform and click **Members** on the navigation panel to the left. Then, click **\\+ New Members** to initiate the process.![image](https://ac.alipay.com/storage/2020/5/11/793a3d8d-5270-405b-9362-e6a670b9c842.png)\n\n### Step 2: Invite members\n\nFill in the member's name and email and then set the role for the member. Roles on the platform are different for the wallet and merchants, see [Workspace member roles](https://miniprogram.gcash.com/docs/miniprogram_gcash/platform/member-role) for more information.\n\n#### For the wallet\n\n- You can set the member as a workspace admin, workspace reviewer, workspace developer, or workspace operator. If set the member as a workspace developer, you need to assign mini programs for the role.\n\n![image](https://ac.alipay.com/storage/2020/5/11/793a3d8d-5270-405b-9362-e6a670b9c842.png)\n\n#### For merchants\n\nYou can set the member as a developer admin, developer, or operator.

If the invitation is expired, you can resend the invitation to the member.\n\n![image](https://ac.alipay.com/storage/2020/5/11/793a3d8d-5270-405b-9362-e6a670b9c842.png)\n\n### Step 4: Manage members\n\nAfter the member joins the workspace, you can block, delete, and set roles for the member. In addition, you can also check the statuses of members.\n\n#### Block members\n\nTo block a member, click **Block** to continue the process. The blocked member cannot perform operations based on the assigned role but the member still displays on the member list.
