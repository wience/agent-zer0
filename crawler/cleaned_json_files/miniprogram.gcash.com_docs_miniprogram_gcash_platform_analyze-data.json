In addition, you can also see the user flow across several events, which is enabled by funnel analysis. To learn more about events and funnels, see [Event management and analysis](https://miniprogram.gcash.com/docs/miniprogram_gcash/platform/manage-event) and [Funnel management and analysis.](https://miniprogram.gcash.com/docs/miniprogram_gcash/platform/manage-funnel)\n\n# Events analysis\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nMake sure you have defined and published an event. For more information, see [define an event](https://miniprogram.gcash.com/docs/miniprogram_gcash/platform/define-event) and [publish an event.](https://miniprogram.gcash.com/docs/miniprogram_gcash/platform/publish-event)\n\n### Procedures\n\n1. Go to **Analyti** **cs** \\> **Performance** > **My Analysis**ï¼›\n2. Choose the mini program that you want to perform data analysis on, then click **Manage Event**.\n\n![image.png](https://yuque.antfin.com/images/lark/0/2021/png/5956329/1614309389450-a250e034-5b3b-4731-bee8-8cc818d1fda2.png#align=left&display=inline&height=355&margin=%5Bobject%20Object%5D&name=image.png&originHeight=544&originWidth=1002&size=53826&status=done&style=stroke&width=654)\n\n3. Define filter conditions for this report.\n\nTake the \"add a product to the shopping cart\" event as an example. You need to configure the event analysis with the following parameters:\n\n![image.png](https://yuque.antfin.com/images/lark/0/2021/png/5956329/1615464843898-d37b971c-3938-4475-b9e5-58236a61c28a.png#align=left&display=inline&height=610&margin=%5Bobject%20Object%5D&name=image.png&originHeight=610&originWidth=831&size=36429&status=done&style=stroke&width=831)\n\n- **Event**: The event to be analyzed. For this event, `addCommodityToSoppingCart` is chosen.\n- **Metric**: Metrics are the fields that were previously defined for the event. These are the dimensions that you can analyze for the event. For example, selecting `addToShoppingCarNum` and `Sum` will indicate the total number of products in the shopping cart. In addition, you can also choose PV and UV as metrics.\n- **Filter**(Optional): Data filter conditions. You can apply filter conditions to all the fields that you have previously defined for the event.\n- **Date Range**: The period when the event was triggered.\n- **Time Granularity**: Choose either daily or hourly.\n\nAfter setting the event analysis configurations, click **Apply**. You can view the analysis results in the form of a graph or table accordingly.\n\n![image.png](https://yuque.antfin.com/images/lark/0/2021/png/5956329/1615465776115-c02a008e-0fd0-4966-b94f-85174bb0ae6a.png#align=left&display=inline&height=440&margin=%5Bobject%20Object%5D&name=image.png&originHeight=440&originWidth=908&size=27868&status=done&style=stroke&width=908)![image.png](https://yuque.antfin.com/images/lark/0/2021/png/5956329/1615465723376-52b5321f-0721-43e5-b04e-6cd11a13b50d.png#align=left&display=inline&height=434&margin=%5Bobject%20Object%5D&name=image.png&originHeight=434&originWidth=919&size=22950&status=done&style=stroke&width=919)\n\nAnalysis:\n\n- On March 9, 2021, the total number of products added to the shopping cart is 13;\n- On March 10, 2021, the total number of products added to the shopping cart is 26;\n- On March 11, 2021, the total number of products added to the shopping cart is 13.\n\n# Funnel analysis\n\nTo analyze a funnel, complete the following steps:\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nFunnel analysis helps you analyze several steps of the user flow. Make sure you have defined and published at least two events. For more information, see [define an event](https://miniprogram.gcash.com/docs/miniprogram_gcash/platform/define-event) and [publish an event.](https://miniprogram.gcash.com/docs/miniprogram_gcash/platform/publish-event)\n\n### Procedures\n\n#### 1\\. Create a funnel\n\n1. Go to **Analytics** \\> **Performance** \\> **My** **Analysis**;\n2. Choose the mini program that you want to perform data analysis on;\n3. Click **Manage Funnel** under the **Manage Funnel** tab;\n4. Click **+** **New Funnel**.\n\n![image.png](https://yuque.antfin.com/images/lark/0/2021/png/5956329/1614328861266-b399900b-d304-4166-a52e-d52d6dee09a8.png#align=left&display=inline&height=190&margin=%5Bobject%20Object%5D&name=image.png&originHeight=379&originWidth=1775&size=45056&status=done&style=stroke&width=887.5)\n\n#### 2\\. Enter the funnel name\n\n![image.png](https://yuque.antfin.com/images/lark/0/2021/png/5956329/1615466067243-7822c0f2-1d60-47a7-814a-e9384333ca91.png#align=left&display=inline&height=114&margin=%5Bobject%20Object%5D&name=image.png&originHeight=114&originWidth=743&size=6159&status=done&style=stroke&width=743)\n\n#### 3\\. Set funnel steps\n\nTake \"user shopping path conversion rate\" funnel as an example:\n\n![image.png](https://yuque.antfin.com/images/lark/0/2021/png/5956329/1615466250167-e9d0fc71-236e-402a-9004-9135f49a203f.png#align=left&display=inline&height=773&margin=%5Bobject%20Object%5D&name=image.png&originHeight=773&originWidth=895&size=47496&status=done&style=stroke&width=895)\n\n- **Steps:** Each step corresponds to an event. You can choose multiple events that are already defined. For this funnel example, select the `addCommodityToShoppingCart`, `submitOrder`, and `payOrder` steps.\n- **Filter**(Optional): Data filter conditions. You can apply filter conditions to all the fields that you have previously defined for the event. In step 3, set `payStatus` is equal to `true`, which filters orders that have been successfully paid.\n\ncopy\n\n```json\ndata: {\n  orderList: [],\n  totalItems:0,\n  commodityAmount:0,\n  orderAmount:0,\n  totalDiscount:10,\n  shopDiscount:3,\n  freightAmount:9,\n  orderId:\"\",\n  payStatus:\"false\",\n}\n```\n\nAfter confirming each step, click **Save** to save the current configuration.\n\n#### 4\\. Analyze data\n\nAfter setting funnel steps, go back to the funnel management page to set funnel analysis conditions and perform customized data analysis.\n\n![image.png](https://yuque.antfin.com/images/lark/0/2021/png/5956329/1615467597996-3803e444-d0e1-453f-8c56-472f7f3a1dec.png#align=left&display=inline&height=259&margin=%5Bobject%20Object%5D&name=image.png&originHeight=259&originWidth=702&size=15364&status=done&style=stroke&width=702)\n\n- **Funnel:** Select the `userShoppingPathConversionRate` that you have already created.\n- **Date Range:** Select the data range to calculate overall funnel conversion. For this funnel example, March 5, 2021 - March 11, 2021 is selected as the range.\n\nAfter setting funnel analysis conditions, click **Apply**. You can view the analysis results in the form of a graph or table. ![image.png](https://yuque.antfin.com/images/lark/0/2021/png/5956329/1615467787124-10062c86-c7cd-4f4d-ba2f-313783e31753.png#align=left&display=inline&height=448&margin=%5Bobject%20Object%5D&name=image.png&originHeight=448&originWidth=946&size=28257&status=done&style=stroke&width=946)![image.png](https://yuque.antfin.com/images/lark/0/2021/png/5956329/1615467644258-cebbf84f-82a3-424d-8db9-ef28e6c45eaf.png#align=left&display=inline&height=417&margin=%5Bobject%20Object%5D&name=image.png&originHeight=417&originWidth=960&size=25679&status=done&style=stroke&width=960)\n\nAnalysis:\n\n- From March 5, 2021 to March 11, 2021, a total of 52 products were added to the shopping cart, of which 32 of which were submitted as orders, and 28 of the submitted orders were successfully paid for.\n- The conversion rates among the three events are 61.54% and 87.50% respectively.\n\nBased on the funnel analysis, you can start your investigations on user behavior.",
