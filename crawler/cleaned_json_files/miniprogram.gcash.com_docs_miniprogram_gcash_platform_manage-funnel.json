Based on the funnel analysis, you can visualize the steps your users take to go through a task and quickly see the conversion rate between two steps. For example, how do general visitors become buyers? How do one-time buyers become repeat buyers? With this information, you can improve user journeys specifically.\n\n### Features\n\nYou can manage funnels in the following ways:\n\n- View the funnel list\n\nYou can modify individual funnels under the funnel list page. All your funnels are displayed on the Funnel List page, and you can modify individual funnels by clicking **Edit** or **Delete**.\n\n![manage funnels.png](https://yuque.antfin.com/images/lark/0/2021/png/217662/1614059174108-33738668-10db-422f-afa4-b3fb13a3fd69.png#align=left&display=inline&height=581&margin=%5Bobject%20Object%5D&name=manage%20funnels.png&originHeight=581&originWidth=1377&size=32715&status=done&style=stroke&width=1377)\n\n- Create a funnel\n\nYou can create a new funnel.
