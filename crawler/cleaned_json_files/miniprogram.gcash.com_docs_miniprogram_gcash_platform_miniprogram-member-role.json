After creating mini programs, mini program members are generated from workspace members. The workspace member who creates a mini program will be set as an admin of the mini program automatically.\n\nWhether for the wallet or merchants, there are two mini program member roles:\n\n- **Admin**: The role can edit mini programs, add mini program members, upload mini programs, set configurations, and release and delete mini programs. A mini program can have multiple admins.\n- **Developer**:The role can upload versions from Mini Program Studio to workspaces. A mini program can have multiple developers.\n\n## Relations illustration\n\nMini program member roles are generated from workspace member roles, you can see relations between them in the following figures:\n\n![image](https://yuque.antfin.com/images/lark/0/2021/jpeg/5956329/1634212251794-79eae3b1-2860-4913-8a44-53be363c030c.jpeg)\n\n- Wallet\n\nFor the wallet, all workspace members can be set as mini program admins or developers. Only workspace admins and workspace developers can create mini programs. After creating a mini program, workspace admins and workspace developers will be set as admins of the mini program automatically. Then admins can invite workspace admins, workspace developers, workspace reviewers, or workspace operators as admins or developers to manage the mini program together.\n\n- Merchant\n\nFor merchants, all workspace members can be set as mini program admins or developers. Only developer admins can create mini programs. After creating a mini program, developer admins will be set as admins of the mini program automatically. Then admins can invite developers (workspace) or operators as admins or developers (mini program) to manage the mini program together.\n\n## Mini program member authorization\n\nMini program members of the wallet and merchants only participate in the workflow from add members to delete mini programs. You can see their authorization in the following table:\n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Operations** | **Admin** | **Developer** |\n| Create mini programs | Mini program members generate after creating mini programs. This step is intended for workspace members such as workspace admins, workspace developers, and developer admins to complete. |\n| View mini programs | ✓ | ✓ |\n| Edit mini programs | ✓ | × |\n| Add mini program members | ✓ | × |\n| Upload mini programs | ✓ | ✓ |\n| Configure mini programs | ✓ | × |\n| Release mini programs | ✓ | × |\n| Remove mini programs | ✓ | × |\n| Delete mini programs | ✓ | × |\n\n## More information\n\n[Workspace member roles](https://miniprogram.gcash.com/docs/miniprogram_gcash/platform/member-role)\n\n[Member role authorization in tenant workspace](https://miniprogram.gcash.com/docs/miniprogram_gcash/platform/tenant-member-authorization)\n\n[Member role authorization in developer workspace](https://miniprogram.gcash.com/docs/miniprogram_gcash/platform/developer-member-authorization)\n\n[How to add members to workspaces](https://miniprogram.gcash.com/docs/miniprogram_gcash/platform/add-member-to-workspace)\n\n[Add mini program members](https://miniprogram.gcash.com/docs/miniprogram_gcash/platform/add_member)",
