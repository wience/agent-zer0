Note that developer can develop the Mini Program, and only the Mini Program admin can create and publish the Mini Program.\n\n## Logging in\n\nAfter completing the registration, log in directly at the login entry on the homepage of the Mini Program Platform.\n\n![image.png](https://idocs-assets.marmot-cloud.com/storage/idocs87c36dc8dac653c1/1623744296421-a9973978-0671-4586-b89f-a2d66beea0c6.png)\n\n## Create a Tenant Workspace\n\nRegister a Workspace in Mini Program Development Platform (MPDP)\n\n### Step 1 Provide the information of your organization\n\nPlease provide the following information and send us email.\n\n- Workspace Name\n- Scope of Business (Please find the attachment[üìéMCC\\_20190701.xlsx](https://idocs-assets.marmot-cloud.com/storage/idocs87c36dc8dac653c1/yuque/attachments/yuque/0/2021/xlsx/561635/1623812073916-802038d8-1785-4145-89ad-f153948e2805.xlsx), and send us the code)\n- Business Address\n- Business Representative Name & Contact Email (You can provide more than one. He/She will become the primary workspace admin of the platform)\n\n### Step 2 Be patient\n\nIt will take us 5 business days to generate a workspace and customized Mini Program Studio. Please be patient and reach us if you have any question.\n\n### Step 3 Your Tenant Workspace is generated\n\nWe will send you back a confirmation email with workspace account information once the workspace is generated.\n\n## Invite members and set roles\n\nGive members controlled access to your Workspace\n\nYou can invite other members ¬†to access your workspace. To protect your sensitive information or restrict the actions they can perform, user roles limit their access. Each member must be assigned a role(In tenant space, you can set the user to be Workspace adminÔºåWorkspace reviewerÔºåWorkspace Developer) when they are added.\n\nTeam members and user roles are managed in your workspace \"Members\" settings page. You can add new members individually, or invite multiple users at the same time.\n\nThe \"Members: settings page only allowed for workspace admin to view and manage.\n\n![image.png](https://idocs-assets.marmot-cloud.com/storage/idocs87c36dc8dac653c1/1733123115667-90092516-ac8c-4c1b-8e11-8be13df91247.png)\n\n## Workspace\n\n### Workspace - General\n\n![image.png](https://idocs-assets.marmot-cloud.com/storage/idocs87c36dc8dac653c1/1733123140457-128c2d02-f512-4fbf-aa64-de13899ab58e.png)\n\nPath: ¬†Workspace Manage\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Role** | **Authorization** |\n| Workspace Admin | ÔºçAble to view the workspace informations. |\n\nWhen you first created a Workspace by providing your company‚Äôs info., our team would generate a workspace with listing all the info. you have provided on the Workspace - general tab\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Field** | **Description** |\n| Workspace ID | Generated by Platform. |\n| Workspace Name | Rule of naming:<br>\\- You can‚Äôt change the name after workspace is generated<br>\\- Character combination A-Z, a-z, 0-9<br>\\- No space<br>\\- Will be used as URL |\n| Status |  |\n| Business Address |  |\n| Scope of Business | Select from the attachment.<br>[üìéMCC\\_20190701.xlsx](https://idocs-assets.marmot-cloud.com/storage/idocs87c36dc8dac653c1/yuque/attachments/yuque/0/2021/xlsx/561635/1623812074540-647fee75-6a41-4b8c-8a62-2b6ac0f371c1.xlsx) |\n| Business Representative | The business representative will be the Workspace Admin as well. |\n| Representative email |  |\n\n-You can contact us to request for information change.\n\n## App Manage\n\n![image.png](https://idocs-assets.marmot-cloud.com/storage/idocs87c36dc8dac653c1/1733123162801-da865eda-b0cb-4abf-ab4e-9be574a5a836.png)\n\nPath: ¬†App Manage - App detail\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Role** | **Authorization** |\n| Workspace Admin | ÔºçAble to add/view App infornation. |\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Field** | **Description** |\n| Mini Program Accessing Key | Mini Program Accessing Key:<br>An unique key allowing container SDKs to access Mini Program data through SaaS. |\n| Mini Program Upload Key | Mini Program Upload Key:<br>\\- An unique key allowing Mini Program Bundles to build and upload to the Console.<br>\\- Container verification.<br>When you are ready to publish your mini program, you need to sign yourCopy mini program and upload it to a workspace portal. |\n\n## Members\n\nFor more information, see [Workspace member roles](https://miniprogram.gcash.com/docs/miniprogram_gcash/platform/member-role).\n\nPath: Workspace - Members\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Role** | **Authorization** |\n| Workspace Admin | ÔºçAble to add/view the member(s).<br>ÔºçAble to set member(s) as other roles. |\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Field** | **Description** |\n| Member's login email | User's registered email. |\n| Username |  |\n| Role | Workspace roles:<br>Workspace DeveloperÔºå<br>Workspace AdminÔºå<br>Workspace Reviewer.<br>ÔºçWhen users first join the workspace, he/she would assign as Developer (Assigned to Mini Program: unassigned)ÔºåWorkspace Admin could set him/her as other roles, such as<br>Workspace AdminÔºõ<br>Mini program Admin(Assigned to Mini Program: unassigned)ÔºöAble to create a new mini program. |\n| Status | Member StatusÔºö<br>1ÔºéActiveÔºõcorresponding action: block.<br>2ÔºéInactiveÔºõcorresponding¬†action: unblock.<br>ÔºçEven the user got blocked, he/she could still log into the console.
