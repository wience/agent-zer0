This helps you build your investments consistently without the need for manual transactions.\n\n### **How to use the GFunds Auto-Invest feature:**\n\n1. On your GFunds dashboard, tap **Set Schedule**\n2. Select the fund you want to invest in\n3. Input the details needed for your scheduled investment. Tap **Next**\n4. Review the details of your investment and select **Set Schedule**\n\nYou’ll see a confirmation page indicating your selected fund has been scheduled.\n\n**Note:** Scheduled investments are processed every **11 PM**, except for holiday orders which are processed the next business day. Please make sure that your GCash wallet has enough funds to cover your scheduled transaction. If your GCash wallet does not have enough funds, your scheduled transaction will not proceed and will retry on the next scheduled date.\n\n### **Need more Help?**\n\nFor other inquiries or concerns, check out the following articles:\n\n- [How can I buy funds in GFunds?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/5351243796377)\n- [How can I sell/withdraw funds from GFunds?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/30843460974489)\n- [How do I track my pending Buy and Sell orders in GFunds?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/900004505786)\n- [What investment products are available on GFunds?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/5951847409049)\n- [What are the GFunds fees I need to know about?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/30841717008025-GFunds-Annual-trust-or-management-fees)\n\n[Previous](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/30843460974489-How-can-I-sell-withdraw-funds-from-GFunds)\n\nHow can I sell/withdraw funds from GFunds?\n\n[Next](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/900004505786-How-do-I-track-my-pending-Buy-and-Sell-orders-in-GFunds)\n\nHow do I track my pending Buy and Sell orders in GFunds?\n\n- [How can I buy funds in GFunds?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/5351243796377-How-can-I-buy-funds-in-GFunds)\n- [How can I sell/withdraw funds from GFunds?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/30843460974489-How-can-I-sell-withdraw-funds-from-GFunds)\n- [How do I schedule automatic investments in GFunds?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/30844023946137-How-do-I-schedule-automatic-investments-in-GFunds)\n- [How do I track my pending Buy and Sell orders in GFunds?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/900004505786-How-do-I-track-my-pending-Buy-and-Sell-orders-in-GFunds)\n- [When will I receive my GFunds Buy or Sell orders?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/900004505746-When-will-I-receive-my-GFunds-Buy-or-Sell-orders)\n\n30844023946137\n\nBack to Top",
