A BIR-stamped Sworn Declaration is among the bases to determine whether the merchant meets said threshold and is subject to withholding.\n\n**Customers will not be affected.**\n\n### What to do next\n\nTo ensure swift compliance with the regulation, **all merchants must submit** the following:\n\n1. BIR Certificate of Registration (BIR Form No. 2303 / COR)\n2. Certificate of Tax Exemption or Proof of Lower Income Tax, if applicable\n3. [Sworn Declaration](https://help.gcash.com/hc/article_attachments/31653530349465) stamped received by the BIR\n\nThe Sworn Declaration will be used to properly determine if the merchant will be subject to the RR No. 16-2023.\n\nPartner Merchants may submit their requirements to GCash via this [link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfYLPo2E4nvnnDZ0d1rvXSR7dkoabG03uGO9_20WDeS1N_Kew/viewform).\n\nFor more information, please refer to the [full text of RR No. 16-2023](https://bir-cdn.bir.gov.ph/BIR/pdf/RR%20No.%2016-2023%203.pdf) from the BIR’s website.\n\n### Refund Information\n\nAccording to [RMC No. 79-2024](https://help.gcash.com/hc/article_attachments/35191547222809), which extends the transition period of Revenue Regulation 16-2023, any withheld amounts due to the delay in notification will be promptly refunded to the merchant's settlement bank account. We ask for the merchants' patience as GCash processes the refunds.\n\n- [RR 16-2023 Memo.pdf](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/31652274960665)\n100 KB [Download](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/31652274960665)\n\n- [Memo on RR No.16-2023 and RMC No. 55-2024.pdf](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/31653008949273)\n200 KB [Download](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/31653008949273)\n\n- [RR 16-2023 Sworn Declaration.pdf](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/31653530349465)\n100 KB [Download](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/31653530349465)\n\n- [RMC No. 79-2024.pdf](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/35191547222809)\n200 KB [Download](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/35191547222809)\n\n- [RMC No. 55-2024.pdf](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/35191857645977)\n50 KB [Download](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/35191857645977)\n\n- [RMC No. 8-2024.pdf](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/35191866902937)\n300 KB [Download](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/35191866902937)\n\n- [GCash Partner Advisory - RR 16-2023 Memo Extension.pdf](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/38801822133529)\n70 KB [Download](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/38801822133529)\n\n\n[Previous](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/37831595333017-GCash-Pera-Outlet-GPO-Plus-Advisory)\n\nGCash Pera Outlet (GPO) Plus Advisory\n\n[Next](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/26245453156633-Advisory-for-using-GCash-on-iPhone-with-iOS-13-and-Below)\n\nAdvisory for using GCash on iPhone with iOS 13 and Below\n\n- [GCash Pro Platform Termination](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/45732029791513-GCash-Pro-Platform-Termination)\n- [Advisory on Automated Fuel Dispenser (Self-Service Gas Pumps) Payments using GCash Cards](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/44449603684377-Advisory-on-Automated-Fuel-Dispenser-Self-Service-Gas-Pumps-Payments-using-GCash-Cards)\n- [Advisory for iPhone Users affected Express Send Feature Issue](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/40583772018073-Advisory-for-iPhone-Users-affected-Express-Send-Feature-Issue)\n- [GCash Pera Outlet (GPO) Plus Advisory](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/37831595333017-GCash-Pera-Outlet-GPO-Plus-Advisory)\n- [Advisory on Revenue Regulation 16-2023](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/31622004752153-Advisory-on-Revenue-Regulation-16-2023)\n- [Advisory for using GCash on iPhone with iOS 13 and Below](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/26245453156633-Advisory-for-using-GCash-on-iPhone-with-iOS-13-and-Below)\n- [Shift of SMS messages to GCash App Inbox](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/10040298426137-Shift-of-SMS-messages-to-GCash-App-Inbox)\n- [GCash Updated Terms and Conditions](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/22717341874585-GCash-Updated-Terms-and-Conditions)\n\n31622004752153\n\nBack to Top",
