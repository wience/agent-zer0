You can purchase your eSIM via the GCash app and set it up without going to a physical store.\n\nNon-Philippine eSIMs from GCash are **data-only** and work with eSIM-enabled iOS and Android phones. They won’t work on SIM-locked devices.\n\nTo buy an eSIM and set it up easily on your GCash app, follow the steps below:\n\n1. On your GCash app, tap **Load**\n2. Select the **country** \\> **eSIM** \\> **Next**\n3. Select your load > **Buy Now**\n\n![](https://help.gcash.com/hc/article_attachments/34186935582105)\n\nOnce you’ve made your eSIM purchase, you will receive an SMS about how to set it up.\n\nYou'll get an SMS when your balance drops to 10% and when you run out of data.\n\n### **Countries where you can use an eSIM bought from GCash**\n\n**Asia**\n\nHong Kong\n\nIndonesia\n\nJapan\n\nKorea\n\nMacau\n\nMalaysia\n\nThailand\n\nUnited Arab Emirates\n\nVietnam\n\n**Australia/Oceania**\n\nAustralia\n\nNorth America\n\nMexico\n\nUnited States of America (USA)\n\n**Europe**\n\nAustria\n\nBelgium\n\nBulgaria\n\nCroatia\n\nCyprus\n\nCzech Republic\n\nDenmark\n\nEstonia\n\nFinland\n\nFrance\n\nGermany\n\nGreece\n\nHungary\n\nIceland\n\nIreland\n\nItaly\n\nLatvia\n\nLiechtenstein\n\nLithuania\n\nLuxembourg\n\nMalta\n\nNetherlands\n\nNorway\n\nPoland\n\nPortugal\n\nRomania\n\nSlovakia\n\nSlovenia\n\nSpain\n\nSweden\n\nSwitzerland\n\nTurkey\n\nUkraine\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nIf you have any concerns about your eSIM, [click here to ask for help.](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000706713&ind=normal&tf_360023219534n) A customer service representative will contact you in **1-2 business days.**\n\n### **Need more Help?**\n\nFor other inquiries or concerns, check out the following articles:\n\n- [How can I activate my eSIM after buying it with GCash?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/34183170218393)\n- [How can I use GCash to buy load?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413709634969)\n- [What are the telco load convenience fees in GCash?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005872843)\n\n[Previous](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/40521720364185-How-can-I-schedule-autoload-for-mobile-and-broadband-load)\n\nHow can I schedule autoload for mobile and broadband load?\n\n[Next](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/34183170218393-How-can-I-activate-my-eSIM-after-buying-it-on-GCash)\n\nHow can I activate my eSIM after buying it on GCash?\n\n- [How can I cancel my scheduled mobile and broadband load autoload?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/40521897454745-How-can-I-cancel-my-scheduled-mobile-and-broadband-load-autoload)\n- [How can I schedule autoload for mobile and broadband load?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/40521720364185-How-can-I-schedule-autoload-for-mobile-and-broadband-load)\n- [Can I buy an eSIM using GCash?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/34186930116889-Can-I-buy-an-eSIM-using-GCash)\n- [How can I activate my eSIM after buying it on GCash?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/34183170218393-How-can-I-activate-my-eSIM-after-buying-it-on-GCash)\n- [How can I use GCash to buy load?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413709634969-How-can-I-use-GCash-to-buy-load)\n- [What are the telco load convenience fees in GCash?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005872843-What-are-the-telco-load-convenience-fees-in-GCash)\n\n34186930116889\n\nBack to Top",
