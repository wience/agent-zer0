Next, make sure your phone supports NFC, which is the technology that powers Tap N' Pay. You may check [this list](https://www.nfcw.com/nfc-phones-list/) to see if your phone comes with NFC.\n\nFor some devices, you may need to go to your phone settings and turn on NFC.\n\n### **Check if Tap N' Pay is available to you**\n\nOnly select Fully Verified users can use this feature. To check if you’re selected, tap “View All Services” on the GCash homepage then find “Tap N' Pay” under Pay. If you don’t see this icon, you may not have been selected yet—but don’t worry, we’re gradually adding more users. You can check back again in the GCash app for updates.\n\n### **Activate Tap N' Pay**\n\n1. Login to the GCash app and tap **View All Services**\n2. Select **Tap N' Pay**\n3.

This is not available on transit, ATM, or e-commerce transactions.\n\n### **Pay with Tap N' Pay**\n\n1. Login to the GCash app and tap **View All Services**\n2. Select **Tap N' Pay**\n3. Hold your phone near the terminal. You’ll hear a beep or see a green light once the payment is accepted.\n\n![](https://help.gcash.com/hc/article_attachments/40265524888473)\n\nYou’ll receive an app inbox message and a push notification, then you’ll be redirected to a page confirming your successful transaction.\n\n### **Need more help?**\n\nFor other inquiries or concerns, check out the following articles:\n\n- [I was charged more than once when I used Tap N' Pay.
