The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas requires Fully Verified users to update their information regularly to keep full access to all GCash features.\n\nUpdate your account before the deadline to avoid getting downgraded to a [Basic GCash account](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/19576345096217-GCash-Features-for-Basic-vs-Fully-Verified-Accounts).\n\nTap to learn how to update your GCash account information\n\n1. Open the GCash app, tap **Profile**, then tap your name\n2. Tap **Update Account Information** \\> **Update your Profile**\n3. Enter the 6-digit code sent to your GCash number, then tap Next\n4. Fill in the needed information and complete the verification\n5. Submit your update\n\nYou’ll get an SMS when your profile is updated. Getting an update on your verification status may take up to **3 days**.\n\nCheck out the articles below about verifying your GCash account\n\n👉 [Accepted IDs for GCash Verification](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/900000948786-List-of-Valid-IDs-to-get-Fully-Verified)\n\n👉 [My GCash account is still not verified after 3 days.
