Your GScore is unique to your mobile number and cannot be transferred. Your new SIM activities would be the basis for your current GScore.\n\nJump to:\n\n- [How GScore is computed](https://help.gcash.com/hc/articles/360017566894#h_01H9QQPX7DQJRAETE477PY7BNW)\n- [Increase or maintain your GScore](https://help.gcash.com/hc/articles/360017566894#h_01H9QQPX7DXV6CNSG4F0X407EQ)\n- [Where to find GScore](https://help.gcash.com/hc/articles/360017566894#h_01GB9DCK7FCBYVFXA0XJCBDAF4)\n\n## How GScore is computed\n\nIt is the trust rating computed for you based on the various activities you do in GCash such as maintaining an active wallet balance, paying your bills, using GSave, GInvest, and GInsure. Metered scoring is not yet available as no score assures the unlocking of lending products. Our system regularly updates your GScore weekly based on your recent activities, which can be seen in the GCash app.\n\nIf you’ve availed of a product before such as **GCredit, GGives, or GLoan, and it becomes unavailable**, there may have been certain policies or scoring metrics that you **did not meet to qualify for GCredit/GGives/GLoan**. Each of the products has its own specific policies in place.\n\n## Increase or maintain your GScore\n\nYour GScore is not computed solely based on the frequency of your usage but considers various components to generate your user score. It is based on your frequent GCash activity, maintaining balance, loan performance (early/on-time payments), habitual payment of bills, regular savings and investments, and your purchase of insurance products.\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| Verify your account | Fully verified users gain access to a wide range of services in the GCash app. All you need is a Valid ID (not expired) and a selfie.<br>Read [Get Fully Verified](https://help.gcash.com/hc/articles/360017722393) to learn how to fully verify your GCash Account |\n| Cash in regularly | Keep a healthy wallet balance and fund your GCash account by cashing in regularly. <br>[Learn the different ways you can Cash In](https://help.gcash.com/hc/categories/360001959874) |\n| Always use GCash for your transactions | Use GCash services such as Pay Online and Pay Bills |\n| Invest in GInvest frequently | Grow your money for as low as PHP 50 and gain access to the products of the country’s most trusted investment companies.<br>[Learn more about the different GInvest products here](https://help.gcash.com/hc/categories/20495893354649-GInvest) |\n| Make GSave deposits regularly | Save for your future with GSave.
