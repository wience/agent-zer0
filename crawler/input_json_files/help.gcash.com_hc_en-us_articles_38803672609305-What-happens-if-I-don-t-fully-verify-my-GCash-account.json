If you don’t, you might face fees or your account could be closed.\n\nHere’s what could happen if you don’t fully verify your GCash account.\n\nLimited Access to GCash Features\n\nIf you don’t fully verify your GCash account, your access will be restricted to basic services only, such as:\n\n- **Cash In**\n- **Pay Bills**\n- **Buy Load**\n- **Offline Cash-In**\n- **Receive Money**\n\nTo learn more about features with a Fully Verified GCash account, [click here](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/19576345096217-GCash-Features-for-Basic-vs-Fully-Verified-Accounts).\n\nAccount Closure\n\n**After 12 months without verification:**\n\n1. **If Your GCash Wallet Balance is Zero:**   - Your account will be **closed**\n2. **If you have money left in your GCash Wallet Balance:**   - Your account will be temporarily **suspended/restricted.** You won't be able to log in or use GCash services\n   - A monthly \" **Basic Account Maintenance Fee**\" of **PHP 15** will be applied to keep your account active in our system. This fee will continue to be charged until your wallet balance is depleted.\n   - Once your balance reaches zero, your **account will be closed**, and you will lose access to GCash.\n\nNote:\n\nThe Basic Account Maintenance Fee is **a monthly charge of PHP 15 for suspended GCash basic accounts**, effective from the date specified in the email. This fee contributes to the management of unverified accounts.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nTo use GCash again, you must [create a new GCash account](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005866623-Create-a-GCash-account) and [get fully verified.](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017722393-What-are-the-steps-to-get-a-Fully-Verified-GCash-account)\n\nIf you want to claim the funds from your deactivated GCash basic account, please follow the steps found in \"How to Claim My Funds from a Restricted Basic GCash Account.\"\n\n### Need more Help?\n\nFor other inquiries and concerns, check out the following articles.\n\n👉 [What are the steps to get a Fully Verified GCash account?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017722393-What-are-the-steps-to-get-a-Fully-Verified-GCash-account)\n\n👉 [Accepted IDs for GCash Verification](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/900000948786-Accepted-IDs-for-GCash-Verification)\n\n👉 [How do I claim my money from a suspended GCash Basic account?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/38827343196185-How-do-I-claim-my-money-from-a-suspended-GCash-Basic-account)\n\n[Previous](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/35141220806169-Why-did-I-receive-a-notification-to-update-my-GCash-account-information)\n\nWhy did I receive a notification to update my GCash account information?\n\n[Next](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/9386228997145-Can-I-get-fully-verified-on-GCash-offline)\n\nCan I get fully verified on GCash offline?\n\n- [What are the steps to get a Fully Verified GCash account?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017722393-What-are-the-steps-to-get-a-Fully-Verified-GCash-account)\n- [Accepted IDs for GCash Verification](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/900000948786-Accepted-IDs-for-GCash-Verification)\n- [I don't have accepted IDs for GCash verification.
