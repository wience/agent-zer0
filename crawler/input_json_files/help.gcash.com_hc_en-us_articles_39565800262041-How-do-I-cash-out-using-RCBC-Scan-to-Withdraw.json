On your GCash App, tap **View All Services**\n2. Select **Cash Out**\n3. Tap **RCBC Scan to Withdraw**\n4. Select **Cash out via QR Code**\n5. Input the amount to cash out and tap **Next**\n6. Review your Cash Out details and tap **Proceed**\n7. Enter the 6-digit authentication code sent to your GCash registered mobile number. Tap **Submit**\n8. You’ll be led to a page with your Cash Out QR code\n\nOnce you’ve generated your QR code, it is **only valid for 5 minutes**. For security, you **cannot take a screenshot or download the QR code**. We recommend generating a QR right before withdrawing at the ATM.\n\n![](https://help.gcash.com/hc/article_attachments/39565816556953)\n\n### **Step 2: Scan the Cash Out QR Code at an RCBC ATM**\n\nFollow the steps below to collect your funds with the generated Cash Out QR Code:\n\n1. On your RCBC ATM Machine screen, press **Enter** and select **QR Cash Withdrawal**\n2. Place the generated Cash Out QR under the scanner\n3.
