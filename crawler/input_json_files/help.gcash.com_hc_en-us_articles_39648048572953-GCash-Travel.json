Tap **My Travel** \\> **My Orders** and click the car rental booking you would like to cancel.\n2. Tap Cancel Booking.\n\n**What happens if my flight gets cancelled or delayed?**\n\nPlease contact and inform the car rental company immediately on your latest estimated arrival time. If you add your flight details to the booking, the car rental company will be able to track your flight and may hold the car for you for up to an hour (given it is within their operating hour, and we don't guarantee the holding of the car).\n\n**My car rental was in a bad condition when I picked it up, what should I do?**\n\nIf the reserved vehicle is in a bad condition at pick-up, raise this issue with the car rental agent immediately and request an alternative.\n\nIf the matter is not resolved, please contact our customer service team so we can try and arrange a suitable substitute with the car rental agent.\n\n**Can there be more than one(1) driver who drives the car while we're using the service?**\n\nYes. Upon arriving at the rental counter, please place the request for additional driver with the counter staff. The additional driver needs to be physically present with you and have the necessary licenses and IDs ready.\n\nYou will pay the car rental company for any additional drivers when you pick up the car. Failure to do so could result in the failure of car insurance protection, which caused the liability to pass to you.\n\nSome car rental companies will generally charge for the additional driver, but some may provide one(1) free additional driver for the order. Kindly consult the car rental company for the exact price scheme and additional driver policy.\n\n**I'm involved in a car accident, how do I claim my insurance?**\n\nWe're truly sorry that this happened. Please make sure the following documents are available and well kept:\n\n- Car Rental agreement,\n- Car Damage Inspection Report\n- Receipt of Penalty Charge for the insurance claim.\n\nTo kickstart the insurance claim, please contact our Customer Service Team and provide us the documents above.\n\nKindly note that the processing time of the insurance claim process can vary depending on the underwriting.\n\nTrain and Bus\n\n**How can I book a train or bus ticket?**\n\n1\\. Select Trains and search for your origin and destination stations along with the departure date to check availability.\n\n2\\. Input the following details:\n\n\\- Origin Station\n\n\\- Destination Station\n\n\\- Date of departure\n\n\\- Number of passengers (adult, senior, and youth)\n\n3\\. Select your desired time and transportation carrier. If no result is shown, you may also tap on Buses to see available options.\n\n4\\. Confirm your seat type and review the policies.\n\n5\\. Tap **Book** and complete the payment. Ensure your wallet balance is sufficient before proceeding with payment.\n\nMake sure you entered the correct email and details. Tap on **My Travel** \\> **My Orders**, find your train or bus ticket booking, and check the \"Contact Info\" to see if your email is correct. Look in your junk or spam folder for the confirmation email.\n\nIf you don’t receive the email, your booking will automatically be marked as \"Canceled,\" and you'll get a refund within **5 working days.**\n\n**Can I reserve a specific seat?**\n\nSeat selection is not supported.\n\nGenerally, the seats are assigned automatically by the train carrier. If you have any special requirements, please contact the train carrier to arrange accordingly.\n\nYou may find the details of the carrier and your order in 'My Travel' > 'My Orders' in your app.\n\n**How long does it take for me to receive my booking confirmation after the payment has been made?**\n\nThe confirmation of the ticket should be done within 5 minutes after your payment. If you have not received your confirmation email, please contact our customer care for more assistance.\n\n**Can I change my ticket date and time?**\n\nWe currently do not support changes to your train ticket, including date, time, or departure-arrival adjustments. If you need to alter your travel plans, we recommend that you cancel your existing ticket and purchase a new one for your desired schedule.\n\nPlease be aware that cancellation fees may apply, and we encourage you to review the refund policy associated with your ticket before proceeding.\n\n**Is my trip covered by insurance?**\n\nWe do not offer insurance as an add-on service at this time. We recommend checking directly with the train carrier to see if any insurance coverage is included with your ticket. Additionally, you may want to consider purchasing travel insurance separately through an insurance provider for added protection.\n\n**Should I check-in earlier to board the train?**\n\nMost train journeys do not require a formal check-in process like airlines, but it is recommended to arrive at the station at least 15-30 minutes before departure. For high-speed or international services, or if security checks are involved, it might be advisable to arrive earlier. Refer to the train carrier’s guidelines for precise recommendations.\n\n**What happens if I lose my belongings on one of your trains or its station?**\n\nIf you lose your belongings on a train or at a station, please contact the train carrier's lost and found department as soon as possible. They can assist you in locating and retrieving your items. You may also contact our customer service for guidance on how to reach the appropriate carrier.\n\n**How do I contact the train carrier?**\n\nContact information for train carriers is typically available on their official websites. In many cases, you can find customer service phone numbers, email addresses, and social media links. If you need further assistance, please feel free to reach out to our customer service team for guidance.\n\n## **Contact the GCash Travel+ Customer Care team**\n\nTap “Get Help” icon under your booking to get in touch with the customer care team.\n\nThe GCash Travel+ Customer Care Team is available daily from **9 AM to 10 PM.**\n\n[Previous](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/40213432323481-Quick-Rewards-by-Hustle-PH)\n\nQuick Rewards by Hustle PH\n\n[Next](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403734482073-What-is-GLife)\n\nWhat is GLife?\n\n- [My GLife voucher is not working.
