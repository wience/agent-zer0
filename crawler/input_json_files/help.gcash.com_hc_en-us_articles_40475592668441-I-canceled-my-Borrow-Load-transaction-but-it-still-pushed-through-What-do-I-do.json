However, you may choose to close your load loan in advance by paying for your total amount due.\n\n**Note:** Fees included in the transaction, including your one-time processing fee, is non-refundable. To avoid this scenario, it is advisable that you double-check all the details in your Borrow Load contract before confirming your transaction.\n\n### **Need more Help?**\n\nFor other inquiries or concerns, check out the following articles:\n\n- [I didn't receive my telco or non-telco load.
