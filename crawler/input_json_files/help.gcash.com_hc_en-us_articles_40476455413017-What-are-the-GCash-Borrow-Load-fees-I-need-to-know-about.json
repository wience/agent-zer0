Check the processing fee and sample computation for late payment penalty fees below:\n\n**Processing Fee**: A processing fee of **PHP 19.00 is charged on top of your convenience fee** (for SMART & TNT promos) for every Borrow Load transaction.\n\n**Late Payment Penalty**: A late payment penalty equivalent to **2.5% of your outstanding balance** will be charged at **three intervals** if you miss your repayment due date:\n\n- 1 day after the due date\n- 31 days after the due date\n- 61 days after the due date\n\n### **Sample Late Payment Penalty Computation**\n\nFor a borrowed load with a principal amount of PHP 100.00\n\n- **Initial Borrowed Amount**: PHP 100.00\n- **Processing Fee**: PHP 19.00\n- **Total Amount Due on Due Date**: PHP 119.00\n\n\nIf you fail to pay on your due date, your late payment fees will be as follows:\n\n**1 Day Late**:\n\n- Penalty: 2.5% of PHP 100.00 = PHP 2.50\n- Total Amount Due: PHP 119.00 + PHP 2.50 = PHP 121.50\n\n**31 Days Late**:\n\n- Additional Penalty: 2.5% of PHP 100.00 = PHP 2.50\n- Total Amount Due: PHP 121.50 + PHP 2.50 = PHP 124.00\n\n**61 Days Late**:\n\n- Additional Penalty: 2.5% of PHP 100.00 = PHP 2.50\n- Total Amount Due: PHP 124.00 + PHP 2.50 = PHP 126.50\n\nFollowing the sample computation above, if you make your payment **61 days after your due date**, the total amount due would be **PHP 126.50** (for a borrowed load of P100.00).\n\nTo avoid any late payment penalty fee, please ensure timely repayments.
