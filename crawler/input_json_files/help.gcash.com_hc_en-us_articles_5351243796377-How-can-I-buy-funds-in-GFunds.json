The price of the fund, called the Net Asset Value Per Unit (NAVPU), is updated daily, not in real time.\n\n### **How to place a Buy order in GFunds:**\n\n1. On your GFunds dashboard, tap **Invest**\n2. Select the fund you want to invest on and tap **Buy**\n3. Input the amount you want to invest with the selected fund. Tap **Next**\n4. Review the details of your investment and tap **Confirm.**\n\nYou’ll see a confirmation page indicating your Buy order has been placed.\n\nOnce submitted, you cannot cancel or modify your Buy Order. If your buy order is cancelled by the system or our partner, your payment will be refunded to your wallet within **2-3 business days**.\n\n### **Need more Help?**\n\nFor other inquiries or concerns, check out the following articles:\n\n- [How can I sell/withdraw funds from GFunds?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/30843460974489-Sell-funds-via-GFunds)\n- [How do I track my pending Buy and Sell orders in GFunds?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/900004505786-Track-pending-orders-in-GFunds)\n- [I can’t buy or sell in GFunds.
