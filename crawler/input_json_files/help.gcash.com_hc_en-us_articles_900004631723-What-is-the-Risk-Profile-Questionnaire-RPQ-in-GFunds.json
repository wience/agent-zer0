It checks how comfortable you are with taking risks when investing your money and helps guide your decisions in GFunds.\n\n**Note:** Opening and maintaining any GFunds account will qualify you for a GCash wallet and transaction limit increase to PHP500,000.\n\n**Before you can invest in GFunds, you need to take the** **Risk Profile Questionnaire**. It ensures that you understand the risks involved and helps you make better investment choices based on your financial goals and risk acceptance level.\n\n### **Types of Risk Profiles**\n\nHere are the three risk profiles you might receive:\n\n| **Risk Profile** | **Description** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Conservative | You prefer safety over high returns. Your main goal is to protect your money, even if it means earning less. |\n| Moderate | You’re okay with some ups and downs. You aim for a balance between protecting your money and growing it over time. |\n| Aggressive | You’re willing to take big risks for the chance of higher returns, knowing that you could lose money along the way. |\n\n### **Key Reminders**\n\n- Once completed, you **cannot retake** the Risk Profile Questionnaire (RPQ) or change your risk profile for **three years** unless GFunds require you to retake it.\n- Your risk profile is a guide when selecting funds. You can still invest in funds with a higher risk than your profile, but you must **confirm a waiver prompt** on the GCash app before proceeding.\n\nHere are the questions you will encounter in the Risk Profile Questionnaire:\n\n| **Question** | **Definition** |\n| --- | --- |\n| What is your net worth? (approximate) | Your net worth is the total value of your assets (savings account, checking account, investments, etc.) minus your total debts (mortgage payments, car loans, etc.). |\n| What is the source of your funds? | Your source of funds is where your money for investing will come from.

Anything in between is considered moderate risk. |\n| Your investment principle | Your investment principle will determine the amount of risk you are willing to take for a certain amount of return. |\n| How knowledgeable are you as an investor? | The level of information you have on the act of investing |\n| Which of the following have you invested in? | - Cash and deposit products (e.g. time deposit, SDA)<br>- Government securities or corporate fixed-income securities (e.g. T-bills, Retail Treasury Bonds, corporate bonds, commercial papers)<br>- Stocks<br>- Mutual funds or UITFs<br>- Insurance products (including variable unit linked products and pre-need)<br>- Offshore funds (including ETFs, REITs)<br>- Structured financial products<br>- Commodities<br>- Real estate |\n| Do you have a regular liquidity requirement? | You have a regular liquidity requirement if you will get cash from your investment regularly. |\n\n### **Need more Help?**\n\nFor other inquiries or concerns, check out the following articles:\n\n- [How can I apply for GFunds?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017753033-How-can-I-apply-for-GFunds)\n- [What investment products are available on GFunds?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/5951847409049)\n- [How do I update my account information in GFunds?](https://help.gcash.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005381886)\n- [I can’t open a GFunds account.
